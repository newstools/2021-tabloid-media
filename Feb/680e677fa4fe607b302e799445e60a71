An intelligence-driven operation conducted by Public Order Police and Cato Manor police officers at the Cato Crest informal settlement, yielded the arrest of a notorious business robber who was found in possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition, on Friday. Police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbele, said: “Police officers received intelligence of a man who was in unlawful possession of a firearm. The operation yielded positive results and a 26-year-old man was found in possession of a pistol and rounds of ammunition. The suspect was taken to Durban Central police station for further processing and he was charged for being in unlawful possession of a firearm and ammunition.” Col Mbele said on further investigation, the suspect was linked to a number of business robberies committed in the Umbilo area.
