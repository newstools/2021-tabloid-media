The presence of patrolling Marshall Security armed response officers in Morningside sent theft suspects scurrying for cover, resulting in the apprehension of one suspect while his accomplice managed to flee, on Thursday. Marshall Security spokesperson, Tyron Powell, said: “At approximately 6am on Thursday morning our Armed Response Officer, while on routine patrol, noticed two suspects carrying a cupboard together with window frames. Our officer approached the suspects and the suspects immediately dropped the items and attempted to flee. One suspect was arrested after a short foot-chase. Unfortunately the other suspect managed to evade arrest. It could not be established where the items were stolen from.”
Powell said the suspect and the stolen items were handed over to the SAPS for further investigation and processing.
