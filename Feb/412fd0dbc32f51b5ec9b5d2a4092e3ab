The Durban metro police are often called to help citizens with numerous troubling issues. Traffic warden, Ashley Diedricks, went beyond the call of duty when he helped deliver a baby in the Durban CBD last Wednesday. Metro police spokesperson, Parbhoo Sewpersad said Diedricks was on duty when he was called by a fellow officer to assist a woman in labour. “The woman was walking in West Street when she began experiencing labour pains. Other officers acted as a human shield while Diedricks delivered the baby boy. Both mother and baby were in good health and were transported to hospital by ambulance.” On a lighter note, Sewpersad said: “The bouncy baby boy is police material and we would like to recruit him since he had been delivered by metro policemen. This is not the first time that the metro police delivered babies from distressed moms in the CBD. I want to commend the team that formed a human shield against onlookers while the baby was being delivered.” Sewpersad said knowing officers go beyond the call of duty is very heartwarming. Traffic warden Diedricks was part of 600 recruits employed by Metro police in 2017 and worked as a paramedic before joining the police service.
