The bid to crackdown on perpetrators of Gender Based Violence (GBV) continues to gain momentum and the KwaZulu-Natal Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Units are striving to make the province a safer and better place for women and children. Police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbele said: “From 1 June to 30 June 2021, detectives from KwaZulu-Natal FCS Units arrested 239 suspects for crimes such as statutory rape, kidnapping, abduction, rape, attempted murder, assault with the intent to inflict grievous bodily harm, child neglect and indecent exposure. The suspects appeared in various courts within the province. Detectives managed to secure 301 convictions and the accused were sentenced to various terms of imprisonment. More cases are pending in court and we are positive the suspects will be receiving sentences that will serve as a lesson to other criminals.” “People who break the law should be removed from society and law enforcement will continue to achieve such positive results if more victims come forward. The victims in these cases should be applauded for being resilient and not letting the perpetrators control or silence them,” added Col Mbele.
