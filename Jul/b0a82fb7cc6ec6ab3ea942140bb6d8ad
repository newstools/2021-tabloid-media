History was made this year as the seaside community of Amanzimtoti hosted the first-ever pride event that took place on 26 June as part of International Pride Month. The celebration was attended by locals and visitors alike. A collaboration between Same Love Toti and Friends Family Restaurant & Pub turned into a day filled with colour and pomp. Locals and visitors were treated to a fun-filled day of performances by LGBTI artists, authors, poets and musicians.  The day was started off with a prayer and a moment of silence for those victims who have been brutally murdered in the recent spate of hate crimes across the country. The day ended with a spectacular live fashion show – with a “little bit of this and a little bit of drag”. Same Love’s director, Kim Lithgow, said, “We were honoured to welcome the US Consul General, Anne Linnee, for the first time to Amanzimtoti. She addressed the audience with grace and warmth, demonstrating her support for the LGBTI community. We also had the ward councillor for Amanzimtoti, Andre Beegte, joining in on the celebrations. Our sponsor, Vodacom, supplied a new cellphone, t-shirts, masks and mugs for our prizes. The event was live-streamed on the Same Love Toti Facebook page.” Lithgow added, “Our thanks go firstly to our funders, Rise Up for Girls, to our VIP guests for their support of LGBTI lives and livelihoods. Thanks also goes to the staff at Friends Family Restaurant & Pub, to the volunteers at Same Love Toti, to the artists and performers, to those selling their pride fashion-line, and to all LGBTI family and friends who shared in this magical day in so many ways. We couldn’t have done it without you.”
