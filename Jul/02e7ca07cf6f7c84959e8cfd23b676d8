As queues snake around a number of service stations across KwaZulu-Natal, petrol giant BP Southern Africa (BPSA) has confirmed that there is enough petrol for motorists amid concerns over panic buying and fears regarding fuel shortages following SAPREF’s recent announcement of a precautionary decision to temporarily suspend operations. BPSA vice president, Taelo Mojapelo, said that there was enough petrol and that they have an adequate amount to meet the demand for fuel. He said the company is monitoring the situation closely while balancing crucial fuel supply with keeping people safe. “Future efforts will be directed towards strengthening our fuels and convenience value chains in the aftermath of this anarchy. In the meantime, we will continue to work with relevant authorities and partners to restore operations to normalcy.” Since the start of the unrest, last week, the sale of fuel had been limited with government passing a law banning the sale of petrol in containers, for safety reasons. A number of service stations were also closed or restricted to just serving emergency services and essential personnel, sparking panic as public transport was also grounded. Mojapelo said amid concerns of fuel being used to start the fires that were burning throughout the protests and looting, SAPREF made a commitment to the safety of its people and that of its strategic assets by temporarily halting production. “The temporary suspension of services has not had any adverse impact on the security of supply. Additionally, some of our supply operations which were interrupted have resumed following a rigorous risk assessment and safety review,” Mojapelo added. Throughout eThekwini, petrol stations are opening between the hours of 8am and 5pm with some limiting the amount that motorists can fill up in a bid to keep people and economy moving.
