UThukela District which covers the areas of local municipalities of Inkosi Langalibalele (Estcourt), Ukhahlamba (Bergville) and Alfred Duma (Ladysmith) is among some of the districts worst hit by recent and ongoing violent looting and property destruction.  KwaZulu-Natal Finance MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube visited the area as part of a province-wide assessment and situational analysis of the incidents of violent protests and looting on Friday, 16 July. The visit is part of a call by KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala that MECs visit their respective districts to see for themselves the aftermath and to also engage the communities in these areas.  “We are calling for restraint and our message is simple; there are incidents of criminality and they should be dealt with as such. The Government of KwaZulu-Natal has intensified its calls for law enforcement agencies to deal harshly with the perpetrators to deter any further damage to our economy. We are saying #NotInOurName,” said Dube-Ncube. The MEC was accompanied by district and local mayors and Amakhosi and political leaders of local structures. The Premier and the Cabinet have already visited a number of areas that have been left devastated and suffered destruction and looting over the past few days. A preliminary extent of the losses established so far estimate the damage to be more than R3 billion. Among the areas that have been hardest hit by the unrest are the warehouses and shopping centres in Uthukela. These include millions of rands worth of stock looted at the home appliance giant Defy factory in Ezakheni and various malls being looted. Other factories looted include Sumitomo/Dunlop Warehouse. The district was also hit by the biggest traffic block as the N3 highway, a major economic artery, was closed to traffic for nearly a week with thousands of trucks with essential cargo supplies which were stuck between Harrismith and Cedara.
