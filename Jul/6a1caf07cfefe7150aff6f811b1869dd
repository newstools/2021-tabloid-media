The popular Drakensberg Polar Bear Swim live event once again took place at the Dragon Peaks Mountain Resort, and much fun was had by all in aid of the Animal Rescue and Animal Angels in Estcourt. Belinda Espag, event organiser and marketer for the event, and Carmen Brander, the event’s brand builder and designer, were overwhelmed by the community support, and extended a heartfelt “thank you” to every participant, spectator, volunteer, and to the Okhahlamba Local Municipality for their support. Dragon Peaks Mountain Resort pulled out all the stops on 26 June to ensure that the event ran smoothly, and supplied enough sanitisers for everyone to feel safe. Pet food donations piled up at the venue, as well as at several drop-off points throughout the valley. “It is absolutely wonderful to see the hearts of our community open up for a good cause,” said Espag. Local businesses impressed the organisers with their generosity by donating prizes worth tens of thousands. Many of these prizes were handed out at the live event, while others will be allocated to online entrants. Online entries were introduced last year during the Covid-19 lockdown. When the live event could not take place, Espag and Brander took the event to social media. “The response was fantastic, so we decided to keep it going,” said Espag.
