The future looks bleak for the Chatsworth Tennis Club which was torched during the week-long riots in the area and the rest of KwaZulu-Natal.  The clubhouse, situated at the corner of the Croftdene off-ramp into Shallcross, was petrol-bombed and burned completely during the violence which erupted on Sunday night. The club s president, Brian Nair, said he and his club members are devastated by the uncivilised attack on the community organisation, which left it completely destroyed. This is the work of criminals and cowards. How would they possibly benefit from destroying a tennis complex. It will take many years for the municipality to rebuild these infrastructures and many more years for the club to replace all its assets. It†is a sad day in our community,  he added. The club also lost priceless possessions including memorabilia, trophies, documents and other keepsakes they have accumulated over the years. The club was set to celebrate their 20th anniversary in October. “I am devastated at the ghastly act. What would they benefit from destroying a tennis club?  Nair questioned. He added that they will not be giving up and that it will take time to rebuild the institution. The club is also home to great talent such as the Ramsunder who has proved to be dominant in club tournaments in the past. For more information, contact Brian Nair on 083-228-3020.
