A total of 37 trucks have been torched in various parts of the province. In Mooi River 28 were burnt, with six on the N2 in Zululand, one in Umgababa, one in Lidgetton and one on the R603.  Conservative estimates are that the damage to private and public property is at approximately R100 million, however the information is still being collated. With KwaZulu-Natal having two strategic ports, this disruption is likely to also have a negative economic impact on other parts of the country.  “We commend law enforcement agencies for the work done so far. Charges against these individuals ranged from malicious damage to property, public violence and business burglary to the contravention of the Disaster Management Act Regulations,” said Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental MEC, Mr Ravi Pillay, who had been at Mooi River following the recent spate of violent protests. At least 28 trucks were torched in Mooi River Toll Plaza while six shops were looted in the town. The current situation is painting a negative narrative for the province of KwaZulu-Natal and cannot be allowed to continue since it will derailing economic recovery efforts, undermining business confidence and may in turn result in the further loss of jobs.  “These criminal actions which are carried out by a few elements constitute a violation of the rights of millions of law abiding citizens of this province who now find themselves unable to conduct their daily business. The blocking of major economic arterial routes like the N3, the N2 and access to ports, the looting of shops and torching of trucks have resulted in the disruption of economic activity,” said MEC Pillay.
