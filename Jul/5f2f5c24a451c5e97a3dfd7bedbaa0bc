A mother from the Siphola area in Umloyomayo is desperately searching for a way to feed her four children following the loss of their groceries, kitchen items and the children’s clothing in a fire recently. “I don’t know how I’m going to feed my children,” said Sindisiwe Magubane after the fire had broken out in a one-room building, in the early hours of Saturday morning, 3 July. The one-room building served as a kitchen and a place for her children to bathe and change their clothing. “We have no idea what started the fire as I had checked all the fires that are used to heat water and cook food; which were put out,” said Magubane. Magubane said that it was nearby residents that had awoken her and her family and alerted them that the room was on fire. She also said that there was no time to collect the children’s clothing or some of the groceries. Councillor Bhehkowakhe Majola told The Ladysmith Herald that he had contacted the Alfred Duma Municipality and uThukela to try and assist them. “I would like to make an urgent appeal to anyone in the community to please come forward and assist the mother and her four children, even if it is to donate some food or clothing,” said Cllr Majola.  For more information on how to help, please contact Cllr Majola on 078-313-4638.
