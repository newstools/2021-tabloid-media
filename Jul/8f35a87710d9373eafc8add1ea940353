As protest action gains momentum on Friday, motorists have had to abandon their trips that would require them to pass through the N2 and N3 highways whilst protestors continue to wreak havoc on KwaZulu-Natal roads leaving behind destruction and chaos. Multiple major roads across the KZN province, particularly the N2 and N3 highways, have been shut down today due to protests. According to various traffic reports on social media, many businesses in the province have also been disrupted by the protest action due to looting and burning of tyres and debris. Although it has not been confirmed, KZN Police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said that the protests may be as a result of the incarceration of former president Jacob Zuma. Many protests on the south coast (Umgababa) of KZN have turned violent, with protestors burning tyres and stoning vehicles that try to pass. Participants have been using trucks to block parts of the N2, southbound. Dudu Zuma-Sambudla, daughter of former president Jacob Zuma, took to social media to say that the protestors who are burning tyres on busy roads in Empangeni , KwaZulu-Natal are her father’s supporters. Mbhele said that there is no evidence that the protests are linked to an alleged shutdown of roads and businesses by pro-Zuma supporters. Social media groups have been distributing images of all the damage that is being done to KZN roads, buildings and even vehicles. There have also been reports alleging that cars are being stoned along the N3, near the Pavillion Shopping Centre. Protesters allegedly attempted to petrol bomb a truck on the N3 as well. Motorists have taken to various social media platforms to express their frustration, anger and fear regarding the violent protest action which is now in full swing. SAPS have urged all motorists travelling along the highways affected, to avoid these areas until the protest action has been brought under control or to use alternate routes.
