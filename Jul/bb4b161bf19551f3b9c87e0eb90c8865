Former President, Jacob Gedleyihlekisa Zuma, has been sentenced to 15 months’ imprisonment after the Constitutional Court found him guilty of contempt of court for defying its order to appear at an inquiry into corruption while he was president. Zuma is ordered to submit himself to the South African Police Services, at Nkandla Police Station or Johannesburg Central Police Station, within five calendar days for the Station Commander or other officer in charge of that police station to ensure that he is immediately delivered to a correctional centre to commence serving the sentence. Following the announcement of Zuma’s sentence, one of his daughters, Dudu Zuma, took to social media to express her feelings towards the judgement, she tweeted, “Amanda! To my father, @PresJGZuma is in high spirits and has no fear. We have a choice between serving our time in Jhb or Nkandla… of course we have chosen to be close to home. Lockdown or no lockdown, we will escort you time.” (sic) In a statement Adv Glynnis Breytenbach, member of Parliament and DA Shadow Minister of Justice and Correctional Services, said, “The DA welcomes the news from the Constitutional Court. Three months ago,the Apex Court heard arguments from the Commission on why Zuma should be jailed for two years after he defied the court’s ruling to testify before the Commission. “On Friday, the DA urged the Constitutional Court to settle this matter as soon as reasonably possible as these delays could serve to embolden Zuma to continue his defiance of the judicial system.”
