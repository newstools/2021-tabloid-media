Motorists have been warned to be cautious whilst travelling in and around Durban as there have been a number of protests on the roads. Garrith Jamieson of ALS paramedics said this comes after many reports on social media of blocked roads and violent protest action. “We would like to advise all motorists to be cautious and vigilant especially on the main routes in and out of Durban and the N3 going to the north towards Richards Bay as there are multiple sites. Words of advice are that the travelling is delayed. We have also seen that there is a lot of looting happening, however the police are out monitoring the situation,” said Jamieson. The reason for the protest action that is widespread has not yet been established, however, a viral message is going around to ‘Shut down KZN’. Its alleged that the action is in support of former president Jacob Zuma who was jailed on Thursday morning, 8 July. According to Durban Metro spokesperson, Senior Superintendent Parboo Sewpersad the road which have been affected by these protests are Umgeni Road and Alpine Road. He said: “At the moment on the M4 incoming, in Clairwood and on the M25 on the KwaMashu Highway there is still some action. We urge motorists and the community to report to the Metro Police contact centre on 031 361 0000 if there is any protest action happening in their area,” said Sewpersad. He confirmed that the Metro and the SAPS have been dispatched to monitor the situation in the various affected areas. Sewpersad said some of the roads have been cleared, however, there has been allegations of protest action which was starting in the Westville area close to the Pavilion. Sewpersad said he had not received any information as yet. The KwaZulu-Natal SAPS were also contacted for comments, however, none has been received thus far. This is a developing story.
