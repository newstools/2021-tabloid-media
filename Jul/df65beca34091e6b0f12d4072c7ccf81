Security company, dRK Tactical Control, responded to WhatsApp messages on Friday, 3 July, about unknown men who were loitering on a municipal property on the corners of Cochrane and Essex Terrace in the Westville area. Shadrack Odayen, spokesperson of d RK Tactical said after information was circulated to dRK’s squad unit in the area, the members went to the scene within minutes. “Upon arrival our reaction members entered the premises and a search was conducted. One man was apprehended as he attempted to flee the scene with an orange bag in his hand,” said Odayen. He said that when the suspect saw the reaction officer he immediately dropped the bag onto the ground. “Our member immediately restrained the suspect while the other officer placed him under arrest and cuffed him. A second suspect was seen fleeing the scene towards the rear of the municipal property. Unfortunately he managed to evade arrest. Upon searching the bag it was established that the suspects were striping the bolts and nuts off the heavy machinery on the inside of the sub-station and were going to sell the items at a local scrap yard. “Police were called to the scene. The suspect was then taken in police custody and a case of theft was registered,” Odayen added. He added that dRK would like to commend the Westville Community Policing Forum members on their vigilance and monitoring of crime within the area and would like to take the stand with the CPF in the fight against crime in the area.
