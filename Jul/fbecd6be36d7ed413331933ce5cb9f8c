The South African  Social Security Agency (SASSA) has urged family members with deceased relatives to  report their deaths.  In an attempt to curtail fraudulent activities, where family members have been found to be collecting social grants on behalf of deceased recipients, SASSA has issued a strict warning to all offenders that they will face jail time for fraudulently withdrawing grant payments. The Social Assistance Act (SAA) says that all grants withdrawn fraudulently on behalf of deceased recipients must be recovered by SASSA. Authorities have issued a strict warning of jail time for all those perpetrators that are found to be guilty of this crime. Meanwhile, SASSA has released the upcoming payment schedules for all recipients.
