Josiah Naidoo, 24, a Clayfield resident was having a haircut at the salon on Rockford Drive when his stationery vehicle was crashed into by a speeding vehicle.  Speaking to Phoenix Tabloid, Naidoo explained that he was in the salon when he  heard screeching sounds. “I ran outside and saw a white Toyota Yaris had crashed into my Mercedes Benz C Class. The Toyota Yaris had capsized and was lying on its side. The driver and the passenger alighted from the car. I could tell they were in shock. “The driver said that he tried to avoid a dog and lost control of the car. The driver had a valid license. The vehicle belonged to the driver’s father. Fortunately, the driver’s father had insurance which will cover the damages to my vehicle.” Naidoo added that the Toyota Yaris was badly damaged with the boot and side panel smashed. “The vehicle also drove into the neighbours yard and damaged the fences well as the water pipe causing it to burst. Fortunately no injuries were reported,” added Naidoo. Naidoo said there are speed bumps on Rockford Drive. “It is alleged that the driver was driving in high speed,” said Naidoo. Gareth Naidoo of KZN VIP confirmed that the incident took place. “A Toyota Yaris lost control and collided with a stationary vehicle. Two people were injured and were transported to the hospital by ambulance, ” said Naidoo.
