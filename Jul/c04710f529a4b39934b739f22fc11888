A Ladysmith motorist had to cut short his business trip, due to violent protests that had broken out along the N3 at Marion, this morning, 9 July. It has been reported that the R103 has also been affected by the protests. ‘It was complete chaos and light motor-vehicles and trucks were forced to stop,” said the motorist. He added that both lanes were closed and a few of the motorists desperately tried to avoid the burning tyres and debris that had been left on the road. “I decided to get off at the next off ramp and made my way back to my home town,  Ladysmith,” he concluded. The motorist told the Ladysmith Herald that he managed to get a few pictures, but felt that staying around longer would only put his life and that of his passengers in danger. Bellowing black smoke could be seen meters high above the N3, as former president Jacob Zuma’s supporters call for a complete shut down. It has also been reported that the Mooi River Plaza has been closed off. Truckers were witnessed trying to block off Mooi Plaza. Police at the time said that various law enforcements are on route. “It was scary, I’m just happy that i managed to get out of it in time,” said the motorist. The motorist added that it best for those travelling along the N3 towards Durban to try and seek alternative routes or stay at home.
