Administrator of the large and growing Made In Chatsworth group and author, Kiru Naidoo, is pleased that South Africans will have to adhere to the watered-down version of the Protection of Personal Information Act (POPIA), which came into effect on 1 July. With South Africa moving towards fully safeguarding and protecting the information of its citizens online, Naidoo, who is also the author of the popular book, Made In Chatsworth, said POPIA forces us to respect each other’s privacy. “The law can punish us for even sharing a photo of another person without their clear consent. We need to take special care of what we share on WhatsApp groups, Facebook, Twitter or any other social media platform. Spam emails are also illegal. One hopes that POPIA puts the brakes on phone numbers being sold to call centres. Call centre agents need work but that must not be at the expense of one’s privacy,” said Naidoo. As part of the process and under Section 40(1) of POPIA, the Information Regulator is empowered to monitor and enforce compliance. The regulator’s enforcement powers came into effect on 1 July, where compliance and monitoring officers will conduct monitoring of compliance with POPIA and the Promotion of Access to Information Act (PAIA). The regulator also has investigative powers in terms of POPIA and PAIA, which allows it to investigate complaints from the data subjects. “The new law forces us to think twice. Don’t share any image or information that you don’t have complete legal right over,” urged Naidoo. The regulator has indicated that it is appointing an enforcement committee which will have powers to issue notices against responsible parties in cases of non-compliance. Non-compliance may result in administrative fines of up to R10 million, penalties and imprisonment.
