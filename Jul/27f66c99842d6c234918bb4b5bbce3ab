SAPS were called in from Pietermartizburg, Winterton, Bergville and Ladysmith, after the seven armed gunmen robbed the Upper Tugela Post Office.  Police were notified and the chase ensued to the Dukaza area, where SAPS managed to track the suspects to a local sangoma’s home where they were trying to hide. It is reported that they had asked the sangoma for prayers of protection against the police so that they will not be arrested. “The prayers did not help, because now they are arrested,” said police who had managed to corner the seven suspects along the Woodstock dam. The suspects retaliated by opening fire on the pursuing police. “The police returned fire, chasing the suspects in a corner. The only way out for the suspects was to make their way into the dam waters. The seven suspects walked in the dam until the water reached their necks, while police waited along the banks for the suspects to make their way out. It did not take long and the suspects headed back to the shore to meet the police, where they were arrested, “ said police. Led by Lieutenant Colonel Asheena Ramlagan, the suspects were arrested. Two vehicles, suspected to be stolen, were recovered. The armed suspects lost their firearms and money bags stolen from the post office in the Woodstock Dam.  Pietermaritzburg SAPS divers, Search and Rescue and Newcastle Search and Rescue were called to recover the firearms and money bags. The suspects may also be linked to two robberies, which took place in Ladysmith and Winterton. It is alleged that on 5 July, a group of armed men entered a shop on Springfield Road in Winterton and demanded cash and cellphones from the employees. At gunpoint, they removed cellphones and an undisclosed amount of cash before they fled in their get away bakkie. A case of robbery was opened at the Winterton police station for investigation. The third incident also took place on 5 July. Security guards were travelling along the R616 when an unknown vehicle blocked their path. The occupants of the said vehicle shot at the security vehicle and as a result, three tyres burst. The suspects instructed the security guard to open the door and deprived him of his service firearm. The security guard heard a loud explosion and he observed the suspects removing cash from the vehicle. Thereafter the suspects sped off in their getaway vehicle with an un-disclosed amount of cash. A case of robbery was opened at Ladysmith police station for investigation. “The arrested suspects aged between 30 and 40 will appear in court soon, facing charges of robbery and illegal possession of firearms,” said police.
