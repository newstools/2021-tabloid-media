Queensburgh Christian Academy (QCA), an independent school servicing the Queensburgh, Pinetown and Chatsworth region has made an earnest appeal for assistance as they are currently in the process of rebuilding the school. The school, which has been a beacon of education for the past 32 years, was unfortunately burned in a blazing fire earlier this year and with the help of volunteers, is slowly taking shape once again. Director of the school, Zion Matthew, said that the school’s vision and goal was to raise the next generation of history makers. “This vision and goal was almost brought to a halt on 23 May when I received a call at 2pm alerting me that the school building was on fire. Upon arrival, I was greeted by a building completely gutted by fire. The setback was devastating for both staff and pupils as well as management, but like the proverbial phoenix, QCA is slowly rising from the ashes,” he said. Having found a new home for the school in Hillary, Matthew and volunteers are currently rebuilding and refurbishing the new building to accommodate learners as soon as viably possible. Educators are currently working from the school hall offering classes online to learners. “It is a mammoth task, but one that everyone involved has taken on with hope and faith to restore QCA to its former glory. As such, QCA is making an urgent appeal to the public and businesses to become a QCA hero by sponsoring or donating towards the following much-needed items: paint double velvet white, oil paint various colours. Two projectors, playground equipment, jungle gyms, trampoline, six laptops, stationary and carpet tiles,” he said. Anyone willing to sponsor towards or donate items can contact Zion Matthew directly on 083 785 1016 or the QCA landline 031-464-0040.
