Sydenham SAPS members, who worked tirelessly to ensure that two babies who were found abandoned at a shack were taken to safety, have been hailed as heroes who went beyond the call of duty. The boy babies, one six days old and the other 28 days old, were found by the policemen at Palmiet Road Informal Settlement in Clare Estate on Saturday. The babies were taken to King Dinuzulu Hospital, formerly known as King George Hospital, for medical assessment and have now been placed at KwaDabeka Place of Safety, where they will receive the love and care they require. Sydenham SAPS Vispol head, Colonel Greg Joseph, said, “Apart from fighting crime, the police are tasked to deal with abandoned babies. These members went beyond the call of duty by making sure the babies were safely placed. This is a mammoth task for the police as it takes us two days to place the babies. Well done to these members from the management of Sydenham Police Station.” Col Josephs said the mothers of the babies have not yet been found and if found, could be charged for child abandonment.
