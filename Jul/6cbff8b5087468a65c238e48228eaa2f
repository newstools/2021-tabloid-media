Tragedy struck on the South Coast where a toddler drowned in a pool at a residential complex in Pennington, earlier today. Netcare 911 responded to the drowning and media liaison officer, Shawn Herbst said: “Reports indicate that a 14-month-old female was found submerged in the pool by a relative. Residents alerted Netcare 911 as well as NSRI Shelly Beach who rushed to the scene to assist.” “On arrival, the patient was found unresponsive and not breathing. It is not known how long the child had been submerged for. A full advanced life support resuscitation was initiated, however, despite best efforts the child’s condition had rapidly deteriorated and she was sadly declared deceased on the scene,” Herbst added.
