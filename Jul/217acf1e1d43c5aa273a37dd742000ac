Scores of highly charged protesters unleashed mayhem with widespread protest action blocking major roads in Durban and across areas in KwaZulu-Natal since before dawn on Friday.  Authorities have been running around to various hotspots trying to disperse the crowds and clear roadways while motorists and employees faced the bleak protest scenes which unfolded leading to chaos and late or missed work days. The protests still rage on with burning debris across roads, stoning of vehicles and looting of a store in KwaMashu with an ATM also being torched. Amidst the havoc wreaked by protesters, a viral message surfaced calling for a protest to ‘Shutdown KZN’ as a bid to show support to jailed former president, Jacob Zuma. The message stated that Zuma’s supporters planned to shut down ‘factories, government, shops and roads.’ According to media reports, Durban metro police spokesperson Senior Superintendent Parbhoo Sewpersad confirmed that there were several active protests on Durban roads since the morning. A contingent of Metro Police and SAPS officers have been deployed in various areas to maintain calm and order. PT Alarms Tactical Units responded to the violent situation in KwaMashu earlier and spokesperson, Dhevan Govindasamy said: “There was pandemonium where about 200 people looted a store. Protesters dispersed upon the arrival of PT Tactical Officers and SAPS members. PT Tactical officers found more than three petrol bombs scattered and a large knife on the scene. PT members are on high alert together with police in the area.” Meanwhile, protesters took to blockading the roads and police were present to monitor and intervene in the KwaMashu vicinity. As the turmoil continues, aggrieved members of the public who have been inconvenienced by the disorder and commotion, are tossing around the word anarchy and are calling for government intervention as citizens and businesses bear the brunt of the rampant lawlessness which continues unabated.
