Since the president’s announcement of the adjustment from level three lockdown to level four, the SAPS have been on the roads to ensure that the community is adhering to curfew times and are not in contravention of the lockdown regulations. Durban central SAPS communications officer, Captain Muzi Maphumulo said the members have been patrolling on foot and in vehicles and are highly vigilant. “In the course of the week and the past weekend the members were on foot patrol in the vicinity of The Workshop when they heard some commotion and screams coming from the underground parking. They walked closer towards where the noise was coming from and were approached by a male who informed them that he had just been robbed by two males at the Smart Exchange and SA Reserve Bank passage.” Maphumulo said the complainant informed the members that he gave chase to the suspects but was only able to apprehend one who was in possession of a firearm which was used when they robbed him. “The members began to search the suspect and found a black firearm in the suspects jeans which after investigations was found to be a gas firearm. The suspect was then arrested, informed of his charge and detained for robbery,” he added. He said on Sunday, 4 July another eight people were arrested during a special operation for failing to comply with the level four curfew. “All eight arrested appeared in the Durban Magistrate’s Court on charges of contravening the Disaster Management Act. All eight were fined and were given various dates to return to court,” said Maphumulo.
