Since the incarceration of the former president, KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng provinces have been gripped by violent demonstrations that had turned into widespread riots and looting. The demonstrations which had started as a free-Zuma campaign had started when he was taken to jail.  SAPS and the army were called into Estcourt after threats had been made against the correctional service.  Estcourt Correctional Service along McFarlane Street has been a hot topic in international and national news, as it welcomed 79-year-old former president Jacob Zuma who started serving his 15-month sentence.  Zuma has been behind bars for the last seven days and Estcourt Correctional Service guards could be seen posted along blocked off roads leading to the prison. Police told Tabloid Newspapers that on Monday morning, 19 July, things in and around Estcourt were calm and that various law enforcement teams and army officials had been deployed. It seemed to be back to business as normal in Estcourt, as the community had visited malls and banks in the area; with the evidence of KFC, along Alexandra and Harding Street being damaged in violent riots.  It was reported that Ladysmith, Winterton, Bergville and Estcourt had gotten off easily from the violent looters, with the deployment of law enforcement being visible.  Zuma faces several cases and the corruption trial resumed at the Pietermaritzburg High Court.
