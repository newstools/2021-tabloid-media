The community of Newlands East has raised concerns over a mysterious undamaged, empty, small coffin which was found at a stream in Galjoen Road recently.  The coffin is wooden and brown in colour and is less than a meter in length. Residents said Newlands East police officers and the Search and Rescue Unit attended to the scene, where they searched the area around where the coffin was found and no human remains were found. Newlands East Watch Community Safely (NEWCS) community liaison officer and executive, Joanne Ryan said she received a call from a vendor, who is situated outside a local school gate, informing her about the coffin. “I called the police and vehicles were dispatched to the scene. The area was cordoned off and a search ensued. Previously druglords and dealers used small coffins to transport drugs. I would not rule out that possibility in this case as well. Drugs are increasing in our community so it is possible that this case is drug-related as the coffin was not damaged.” Police spokesperson, Captain Nqobile Gwala, confirmed that a small coffin was found abandoned in a stream in Newlands on 23 June. “No remains were found inside,” said Captain Gwala. Speaking about how to combat the spike in crime and drug-dealing in the area, Ryan said, “Crime is really increasing in Newlands East, West and surrounding areas. More manpower and vehicles are needed for our police station. “At our CPF meeting it was brought up and the station commander, Colonel Ngcotholoza, informed us that they are having a lot of challenges at the station. We are now appealing for more men and women to join our neighbourhood watch, NEWCS, so we can be the eyes and ears for the police and try to assist where possible. “Residents need to keep an eye out for each other’s houses and inform each other if they see something or someone breaking in. Also buying of stolen goods is also a crime. Scrapyards need to get closed down in and around the area.”
