 “The only way South Africans will be protected by the coronavirus second wave is by developing herd immunity through vaccination” said health minister, Dr Zweli Mkhize at a media briefing on 3 January. Mkhize was giving an update on government’s efforts to expedite vaccines to all South Africans. He said that efforts are being made to obtain vaccines, “hopefully as early as February 2021”. Mkhize said that the vaccines will need to be made available quickly so that most of the citizens are covered by the end of the first year of rollout- this year. “We believe that the issue of rolling out vaccines has to be handled with urgency and that is what has driven us to expedite the availability of vaccines. We want to assure the public that we are mindful of the urgency, particularly as we feel the impact of the second wave we are currently experiencing,” said Mkhize.
He said that vaccines will be made available to all South Africans, starting with frontline health care workers and the most vulnerable. The target is to vaccinate minimum of 67 percent of the population to achieve herd immunity in a phased rollout of the vaccine: Phase One
• Front line health care workers. Target population: 1,250,000
Phase Two
•Essential workers. Target population: 2,500,000
•Persons in congregate settings (homeless shelters, prisons, detention centers etc.) Target population: 1,100,000
•Persons >60 years. Target population: 5,000,000
•Persons >18 years with co-morbidities. Target population: 8,000,000
Phase 3
•Other persons >18 years. Target population: 22,500,000
By the end of phase 3, 40 350 000 citizens will have been immunized which is equivalent to approximately 67, 25 percent of the population. Mkize said that vaccines secured through COVAX will ensure that 10 percent of the population will be immunized. The vaccines are expected to be delivered by beginning of the second quarter. The funds to pay the outstanding amount after the deposit that has been made by the Solidarity Fund, around 1,8 billion, have been allocated. “Having secured for 10 percent of the population, we have embarked on other efforts to get the rest of the 57 percent of the population to be targeted by the end 2021,” said Mkhize. He said government is in bilateral negotiations with various companies and medical aids as well as embarked on Public Private Partnerships to be part of the co-financing. The total financing arrangement will include medical schemes, business and government. To optimize availability of stock, negotiations with manufacturers are ongoing. Government is pursuing those who are indicating that they can make vaccines available sooner.
Mkhize said that discussions at this stage are bound by non-disclosure agreements (NDA) but announcements will be made as soon as negotiations are concluded and the NDA’s have been lifted. The Ministerial Advisory Committee (MAC) on Covid-19 vaccines has been appointed to advise government on vaccines. MAC consists of experts in the field and is chaired by Professor Barry Schoub. “A lot of work has been involved and we will be doing more to communicate to the public to dispel some misconceptions and to ensure preparation for this massive campaign particularly because some of the vaccines will require two doses and it will be very important that we do not lose clients to follow up,” said Mkhize. Meanwhile, as at 3 January a total of 1,100,748 confirmed Covid-19 cases have been identified with 11 859 new cases. 402 Covid-19 related deaths have been reported. This brings the total to 29 577 deaths. The recoveries now stand at 903 679 at a recovery rate of 82,1 percent.
