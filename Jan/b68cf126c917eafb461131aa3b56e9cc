The sewage flowing on Inkosi Bhambhatha Road in Emagwaveni, Tongaat, has left residents fuming because of the health hazards posed. Residents complained that this was an ongoing problem “for a long time”. They believe that they are at risk of contracting diseases. Angry residents said the stench of sewage water flowing down their road was unbearable saying that they exhausted all avenues of fault reporting. Residents said that they first reported the problem to the eThekwini Municipality’s water and sanitation on 1 November last year. Residents claimed that when they tried to report faults their calls were either not answered or they were given reference numbers and there was no prompt response. Nkosikhona Dube, who lives there, said sewage flowed down the road for weeks. “We reported the problem on the first day, but no action was taken to fix the fault. Our main concern was that the sewer was close to the homes and children were playing in the dirty water,” he said. Another resident, Nombuso Ndlovu, said: “We are concerned about the lack of response from the city, especially in emergency cases where our health is at risk. The sewage is seen flowing down the road causing an unbearable stench. She said the entire neighbourhood was affected as they also had to drive through the sewage. She said that she was concerned about the wellbeing of children who often played on the road during the holidays. Ndlovu said that she received two reference numbers from the municipality proving that the fault was reported, but the problem has still not been resolved. “We have tried everything now. No one seems to be concerned about our plight,” she said. Ward 58 councillor Geoff Pullan said that he was aware of the problem. “I have also reported the fault to the municipality several times, but nothing happened.” The municipality had yet to respond to the media enquiry.
