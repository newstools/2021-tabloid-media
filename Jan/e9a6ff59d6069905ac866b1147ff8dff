The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) has called on the eThekwini Municipality to accelerate the process of issuing title deeds to residents within the City. This comes after former councillor, Jonathan Annipen, now IFP leader in Phoenix received numerous requests for assistance from local residents. Annipen recently assisted a Phoenix family that had been waiting for 20 years for their title deed. “I was approached by Mrs Govender from Caneside who completed paying her housing loan several years ago and was due to receive her title deed. She received a letter informing her that she should collect the document from a certain Municipal office in Durban but when she got there, she was given the run-around,” said Annipen. “After all attempts to resolve the matter herself failed, she reached out to me. I contacted the respective housing managers in the area and it was discovered that the conveyancers which the city used had delayed the process. I informed these officials that the delay had nothing to do with the resident and having paid for her home, the city had a responsibility to keep their end of the bargain,” said Annipen. Annipen added: “I further informed them that if they failed to resolve the matter, we would have no choice but to seek alternative relief. It was only after our intervention as the IFP, did the city fulfil their responsibility and finally, Mrs Govender now has her title deed.” A joyful Mrs Govender expressed her gratitude to Jonathan Annipen and the IFP. “If it were not for the hard-work and resolve of Mr Annipen and his party I would not have been able to complete this process. The Municipality pushed me from pillar to post and I was on the verge of giving up, then Annipen came to my rescue. My family and I are eternally grateful to him and the IFP,” said Govender. Annipen encouraged residents in need of help regarding similar matters to WhatsApp their complaints to the service delivery line on 064 508 6343.
