 A family trip has turned into a nightmare after a mother died and her two-year-old daughter was seriously injured in a car accident near Umdloti off ramp, on Wednesday afternoon. The father, the mother and daughter were traveling in the Jeep Grand Cherokee on the N2 towards the Umdloti off ramp when the accident took place. Prem Balram of Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa), said that the mother was found by paramedics lying on the highway about 40 meters away from the point of impact. “When our paramedics arrived on the scene, members from a private ambulance service were in the process of stabilising the seriously injured toddler. The body of a woman was lying a bit far from the child,” he said. The father was not injured. Balram said that the deceased’s husband stated that they were forced to stop on the third lane after the Jeep Grand Cherokee they were traveling in had a tyre puncture. “They got off the vehicle and the husband was in the process of removing the spare tyre when a Land Rover collided into their vehicle before running over his wife and child,” he said. The occupants of the Land Rover were not injured.
