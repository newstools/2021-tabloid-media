Rowena Hawkey, a 69-year-old patient at Wentworth Hospital who was seen in a viral video shared on social media crying for help and shouting out that she was unable to breathe, died on 6 January. The family said that the daughter, Teresa, only found out of her mother’s passing when she went to visit her on Friday, 8 January. The family said they were informed on Saturday morning. In the video Hawkey can be heard shouting, “I can’t breathe. Please get me out of here. I’m gonna die like this.” Hawkey can also be heard saying that she has asked everybody to help her, however, nobody wanted to help. The video also appears to show other patients inside the room, where two are lying on the floor. Tracy Williams from Wentworth Angels, a non-profit organisation (NPO) who assists the vulnerable in the community said Hawkey lost her fight due to the negligence of Wentworth hospital. “In the video it shows no doctors or nurses coming to assist the patients for almost an hour. The MEC of health says patient confidentiality is not being practised. If this video didn’t leak we would have not known what our people are going through at Wentworth Hospital,” said Williams. “Where are the directors and the ward councillors? These people are appointed by the community to have our best interests at heart. To stand up and speak for us,” said Williams. Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu, KZN Health MEC said that they have noted the video clip that is being widely circulated on social media which depicts patients from Wentworth Hospital in an “apparent state of discomfort.” Simelane-Zulu condemned the filming and distribution of video footage of patients within the care of the department, without official authorisation, and the patients’ permission. She said the matter is being investigated. Simelane-Zulu said a high-level delegation of managers from head office established that:
· The patients who were filmed were awaiting their Covid-19 results,
· On the day in question, the hospital had received a particularly high number of patients;
·  11 doctors were away in isolation, after testing positive.
·  17 nursing staff were off, due to Covid-19. Six nurses were in charge of the Accidents and Emergency Unit, as well as a 28-bedded short-stay ward with very sick patients. Simelane-Zulu said the delegation has since assisted the hospital to ensure that patient flow is managed properly, through making alterations at Wentworth Hospital’s Accidents and Emergency Unit, which has created space for more beds and sending recovering patients to Clairwood Hospital, while those who need oxygen are sent to isolation. Williams said that in her eyes, the late Hawkey is a hero because her death exposed everything they have been trying to stop at Wentworth hospital, including the neglect, racism and inhumane treatment.
