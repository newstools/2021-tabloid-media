A high-speed chase ended on a high note for crime fighters and law enforcement officers when four suspects were arrested recently after a stolen vehicle was spotted in Amanzimtoti. According to ET Rapid Response spokesperson, Tony Lokker, a vehicle which was sought by police on a Pinetown theft of motor vehicle case was circulated over the Community Crime Prevention Organisation (CCPO) network due to it being spotted in the Amanzimtoti area. “One of our ET Rapid Response officers then proceeded to the N2 north-bound to hold observation for the wanted vehicle. Shortly after holding observation, the wanted vehicle was spotted travelling along the N2 north-bound by our member, and our member continued to follow the said vehicle, whilst requesting for further assistance,” said Lokker. He added: “Whilst our member was following the vehicle, the suspects noticed that they were being followed, and increased their speed, driving recklessly and changing lanes through traffic. A pursuit then ensued. The suspects’ vehicle then diverted from the N2 north-bound back to N2 south-bound as they were attempting to get away from our member.” Lokker said as the pursuit continued through the Prospecton area, the suspects continued traveling at high speeds, speeding through red traffic lights and intersections. The pursuit then continued towards the Athlone Park area along Andrew Zondo Road, which then resulted in the suspects colliding with a municipal waste truck. The suspects’ vehicle came to a halt near the corner of Andrew Zondo and Inyathi Road. Lokker said four suspects were found in the vehicle and they had sustained injuries from the collision. A large contingent of private security, CCPO, SAPS Flying Squad and Metro Police members arrived to assist the ET officer. Lokker thanked all respondents for the back-up and support and commended the ET officer for his bravery in the face of imminent danger.
