The National Indian Congress of South Africa (NICSA) in partnership with various sponsors and donors took on the arduous task of serving the community of Chatsworth with much-needed water after being stranded for almost a week without water. Vassie Govender, founder of Phoenix-based non-profit organisation said that his organisation, RAGS was humbly requested to assist in distributing the water to the various communities. “In partnership with NICSA, RAGS, Venk-Pak, and various other stakeholders, we managed to assist many residents of Chatsworth and surrounding areas. What was however, disappointing is that the lack of responsibility by the younger generation that were few and far in making sure that the elderly were being assisted in this time of crisis,” said Govender. He said that as RAGS, they ensured that they were able to take the water to the most vulnerable and that was the elderly, pensioners, Covid-19 infected and or disabled people in the community. “The Ramakrishna Centre based in unit 9 Chatsworth was kind enough to allow the use of their premises as a depot/distribution centre. We must say that it was not an easy task as we were based in Phoenix and we had to gather water from Verulam and Phoenix and take it up to Chatsworth,” said Govender. He added: “A very big thank-you must go to Venk-Pak and NEC for the jojo tanks, flow-bins and their trucks that were provided at their own cost to ease the task.
The community of Moorton and Welbedact benefitted the most as we were stationed there. I must state that many businesses, companies, volunteers and individuals had come forth to assist communities that were desperately in need of our assistance, we salute you. A very big thank-you to Karou Charou KC for coordinating the entire project which was well planned and executed.”
