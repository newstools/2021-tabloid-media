Grief stricken family and friends paid their last respects to Dundee SAPS Constable Santhosh Ahir who tragically passed away on Saturday afternoon, 2 January, after losing the battle against Covid-19.  Ahir had been bravely fighting for his life in hospital for the past week. Community and family members stood along the pavement on Kleinman Street and paid their respects to Ahir on 3 January. Covid protocols were followed by sanitizing, wearing of masks and social distancing. Social media became a wall of remembrance as friends and family shared the news of his death. Ahir was the youngest of three children. “We did not expect this, we were all praying for him to recover,” said a close family friend. Ahir was 29-years-old and was engaged to be married to Ladysmith SAPS Constable Shalona Shai Dubree. The couple met nine years ago at police college when they studied together. “Ahir and Dubree were made for each other and they were a power-couple in Ladysmith as they both believed in fighting crime. Both shared a great passion for helping the community of Ladysmith and Dundee and had been involved in community upliftment projects,” added the friend. Speaking to the Ladysmith Herald, the friend said that Ahir told his fiancee he knew once he enters into the hospital, he would not be returning home. “About three days before his death, he took a selfie and sent it to Dubree.” He apologised and said: ” I am really sorry, that I will not make it home.” The hearse stopped outside Ahirs home to allow family and friends to bid farewell to him. Members of the Ladysmith SAPS formed a guard of honour as the body of the young constable was taken to the Ladysmith Crematorium. A motorcade was also formed to honour Ahir,  as emergency services such as Okhahlamba Fire and Rescue, Dave’s Panel beaters, ER24 Ladysmith, Innovamed Private ambulances and SharajEMS with the local motorbike club followed the hearse to the crematorium.
