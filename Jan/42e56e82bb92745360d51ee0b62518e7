Going to work during the Covid-19 pandemic has placed frontline workers under immense and unprecedented pressures, putting their physical, mental and social well-being at risk. To care for these hard-working individuals, a group of volunteers have started a non-profit organisation (NPO) called the North Durban Victim Support Team. The organisation which operates at the victim-friendly room at the Durban North SAPS provides free counselling to frontline workers and their families. Channel Cromer-Wilson, trauma debriefer for the organization said that the NPO commenced with its services when the country went back into lockdown level 3. “The frontline workers are overwhelmed, working long hour as the numbers in our country climb, we offer them a safe space to talk through their experiences about the pandemic and tools to assist them handle what they are going through,” said Cromer-Wilson. She said that as much as the initiative is for the frontline workers and their families, however, the team does offer trauma debriefing to the community. Shannon Naylor, another team member said that they train volunteers offering a variety of pyshco-social services to the community free of charge. Naylor said that the group also offer trauma debriefing and counselling for victims of crime. “To our community you are not alone, we are in this together. Be brave and keep positive,” said Naylor. “We would like all frontline workers and their families to know we are in this together and that we as a community thank, appreciate and respect them all the sacrifices they are making for us. They are our real-life heroes,” Cromer-Wilson added. For more information, call 066 483 8589 or visit the North Durban Victim Support Team Facebook page.
