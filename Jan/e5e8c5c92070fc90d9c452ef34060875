Stormy weather that swept across KwaZulu-Natal last month contributed to making the seventh edition of the uBhejane Xtreme iSimangaliso Edition MTB Challenge the toughest staging of this unique ultra marathon. Brave riders setting off for the 350km and 270km Long Horn and Short Horn rides left a few hours earlier than planned to give enough time to ride though iSimangaliso Wetland Park to the final destination of Bonamanzi. Once the riders reached the dirt roads around Mtunzini they were greeted by slippery, muddy roads that sapped their energy and drained their average riding speed, putting into serious jeopardy their ability to finish the entire ride in the safety of daylight. The 350km and 270km riding groups both opted to head for the nearby highways and use 53km of tar riding to keep their end goal realistic by riding on the highway. The riders converged with the 130km and 60km riders later in the day where they could enjoy the easier, quicker ride through iSimangaliso Wetland Park. Former rugby player Joe Pietersen hosted his own group on the 130km ride representing his Nkombe Rhino project. As the ride neared its end the battered and weary MTB enthusiasts were able to enjoy the enormity of what they had overcome on the day, and enjoy the local hospitality.
