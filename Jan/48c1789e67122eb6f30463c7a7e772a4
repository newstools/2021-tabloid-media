No injuries were reported following a brazen jewellery shop robbery at the Gateway Theatre of Shopping earlier today (Friday, 15 January).

According to Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa), they received a call from a shopper just before 9am reporting shots being fired at the mall.
The jewellery store was completely damaged in the heist as robbers smashed glass top counters to grab jewellery and other items. Michelle Shelley, marketing manager at the Gateway Theatre of Shopping confirmed the incident and said robbery took place at the centre at approximately 8.35am and no tenants or customers were harmed during the incident. Shelley said: “The centre’s security teams immediately responded to the scene and the South African Police Services were notified, and responded soon after. The perpetrators made off with an undisclosed amount of goods. The safety and security of customers and tenants is of utmost importance and we are working with the police to assist with their investigation.” She said that the centre was secure and was operating and trading as normal, as per lockdown regulations. KwaZulu-Natal police provincial spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele told Tabloid Newspapers that it is alleged that a group of armed men broke the glass door and entered the jewellery store at the mall and made off with an undisclosed amount of cash and jewellery. “They fled the scene in their getaway vehicle which was later found abandoned on the M25 in the Greenwood Park area near a service station. No injuries were reported,” said Mbele. Rusa’s Prem Balram said that when their officers were dispatched to the scene they found several private security companies and police there already. “Details surrounding the robbery are sketchy at this stage, however, it is believed that the robbers fled in a Toyota Corolla with jewellery stolen from the business,” said Balram. Mbele said that a case of robbery was opened at the Durban North police station.
