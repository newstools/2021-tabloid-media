I Care, is appealing to the public to not to give street children money. The Durban- based organisation helps by transforming the lives of street children in and around the Durban area. Gail Elson, marketing manager for I Care said that giving these children money enables and prolongs their stay on the streets. She said that this could in turn encourage substance abuse, which can lead to crime and all sorts of unacceptable and bad behaviour. “Sadly, many children come to the streets during the school holidays with the preconceived idea that they will make themselves plenty pocket money,” she said. According to the South African statistics for the year 2019/20 released in July last year shows that more than six out of ten children which makes up 62,1 percent are identified as multidimensionally poor, this according to a report on Child Poverty in South Africa. Elson said that most of these children make their way on the streets with hopes to make extra cash because of their poor backgrounds. “With many generous holiday-makers in our city until this time, some of these street children are getting in excess of R500 a day begging at traffic lights and intersections which makes it even harder to get rid of them,” she said. “I Care, who have been successfully  transforming the lives of these children for the past 18 years and we are strongly appealing to the public to support us. If they would like to make a donation, rather make it to I Care assisting us in our work with these children,” she added.
