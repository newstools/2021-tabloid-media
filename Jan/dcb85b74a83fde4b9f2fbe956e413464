Police have issued an alert to members of the public to be aware of a current scam taking place in the Durban area where a person claiming to be ‘Colonel Van Niekerk’ from provincial head office would call people and tell them they have a rape case against them and a warrant of arrest has been issued. He would promise to assist them to evade arrest if they pay him an amount of money. Captain Nqobile Gwala, police spokesperson, said: “In a recent incident a potential victim was told that he was a suspect in a rape case and the sex worker who was not paid for services had opened a case of rape. The victim was told to pay the escort agency an amount of R3 000 in order to evade prosecution as a warrant of arrest was issued. “The victim knew that he was not a suspect in any case of rape and was surprised by the whole ordeal. We are appealing to the community not to fall victim to such scams. Under no circumstances will a police officer ask for money from suspects or the victims of crime. “Victims of such a scam or any other scam are urged to report to their nearest police station or call Crime Stop on 08600 10111,” Cpt Gwala added.
