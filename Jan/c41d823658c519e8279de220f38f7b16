Residents of Newlands West in ward 37 are livid with the shoddy workmanship by municipal workers. They claim that there was no plausible reason for city workers to re-surface the roads in Innerwest Place and Jollywest Place as it was well done and of good quality, but now the roads are left with potholes which is causing damage to their vehicles. “The roads look pathetic after contractors put a thin layer of slush which is coming off. The tar is coming out and getting into our cars. There were no potholes before and it boggles the mind why they started resurfacing these roads. They should have left the original surface as it was in good form,” a resident of ward 37, who wished not to be named, said. He said that his pleas for redress are falling onto deaf ears. “After complaining, the contractors came to sort out the potholes but the work was of poor quality. The patchwork looks pathetic,” he said.
The resident told the Springfield Weekly Gazette that ward 37 councillor Gugu Zulu, was contacted and is aware of the complaint. “I vented my frustration to the councillor about the poor quality workmanship. The councillor only mentioned that the complaint was noted. “The resident said that he is not receiving any joy from the municipality. “We have reference numbers to prove that we have contacted the municipality. The problem is, we are getting no assistance. This includes issues with the bushes and trees that the housing department did not clear for a year now. From the time parks and gardens transferred all vacant land to the housing department, we are witnessing all the overgrown trees and bushes, leaving the area looking in a state,” he said. Residents complained that criminals are using the bushes as an advantage to hide and get away with acts of crime. EThekwini Municipality was contacted for a comment, however, none was forthcoming at the time of going to print.
