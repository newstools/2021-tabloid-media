Durban Youth Radio, a non-profit organisation (NPO) is calling on communities and individuals to support their ‘Back A Buddy’ campaign. The station is relying on donations from the public through this campaign to help better equip the youth with skills in the broadcasting sector. Kevin Minter-Brown, head of marketing and training, said that they have helped at least 22 youngsters over the last few years to secure employment in radio broadcasting. “The Back A Buddy crowd-funding is essential to the continued running of the station. We are under immense pressure financially due to the pandemic but we simply have to carry on. I believe that what we do, in training the youth, is essential in creating new careers for aspiring broadcasters,” Minter-Brown said. Minter-Brown said that without DYR there are very few, if any, other avenues for the youth to learn and master their craft in order to prepare them for careers at commercial radio stations or other broadcast media outlets. “We are asking the community of Durban to get behind us, as we know we have developed a huge fan-base in the ‘031’, and after five years in the current format, DYR is growing into one of Durban’s favourite stations and as such we are appealing for all and any ‘donations’  through our crowd-funding exercise in order to offer financial assistance for transport to our young team of trainees, something they struggle with on a daily basis,” said Minter-Brown. Minter-Brown said contributions received will go towards providing a powerful platform for the youth in Durban to find employment and to find their voice.
