The shocking discovery of six dumped foetuses inside a rubbish bin in the Durban Central Business District (CBD) has prompted a probe into the horrific incident after a vagrant raised the alarm on the atrocity, during the weekend. Police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbele, confirmed the incident and said: “A concealment of birth case has been opened at Durban Central Police station after six foetuses were found inside the rubbish bin in the Durban CBD. Police were informed by a member of the community after he noticed an unknown male dumping the plastic bag inside the rubbish bin. The investigation continues.” According to a social media report from Community News Network, vagrants in the Albert Park area alerted an armed response officer on routine patrol that they discovered between seven and 10 unborn foetuses in the trash. It is alleged the fetuses were frozen. The post further stated that an officer from Blue Security went to investigate and upon making the grisly discovery notified the SAPS 10111 call centre.  Blue Security community and media liaison officer, Andreas Mathios said: “The officer had been on routine patrol in the area when he was flagged down by vagrants in the park who alerted him to their discovery of between seven and ten unborn foetuses dumped in some nearby trash. After following up, and confirming that there were indeed a number of frozen foetuses dumped in the rubbish, the officer immediately contacted the SAPS 10111 call centre.” “Members of the SAPS and a government mortuary van arrived a short while later and cordoned off the area whilst continuing with their investigation into piecing together the crime scene. Detectives were also at the Park and the possibility of an illegal abortion clinic has not been ruled out.” Mathios added that the investigation is on-going and anyone with information can notify 10111.
