Figo Arnold, founder of the Newlands East Relief non-profit organisation (NPO) called on residents in the Newlands East community to donate groceries towards the vulnerable. The organization works towards assisting the vulnerable in the community with food and lockdown relief. “We are desperately in need of canned food, rice, beans, sugar, oil, maize meal and any non-perishable items,” Arnold said. Arnold requested residents to spread the word across the community and urged them to assist with the cause as families are struggling due to the coronavirus impact. “I collected food items from residents who were generous to redistribute to those in need. We are still collecting items to give the vulnerable. We are a community who takes care of its own,” said Arnold. Arnold said that he was happy and greatly appreciated the support from the residents who stepped up and assisted with donating items. “Thank you to all the Newlands East residents who assisted with this initiative, I greatly appreciate it.” For more information WhatsApp your name and address to 0795158802.
