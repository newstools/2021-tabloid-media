Four brazen armed robbers wielding firearms and knives held up a tuck-shop on Bankford Road in Sunford last Wednesday. They made off with cash, a cellphone airtime dispensing machine, cigarettes and cellphones. Members of Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) were dispatched to the scene at 4.14pm. Prem Balram, Rusa head said: “On arrival it was established that one of the suspects entered the store under the pretence of making a purchase. Three other men entered the business after him and held up the owner and a customer. Two suspects were armed with firearms while their accomplices were in possession of knives.” Balram said that the alleged robbers stole an undisclosed amount of cash, a cellphone airtime dispensing machine, seven cartons of cigarettes and three cellphones before fleeing in a blue Honda Ballade with registration NR 19243. “One of the cellphones belonged to the customer who was in the store at the time of the robbery. A registration check confirmed that the number plates of the getaway vehicle belonged to a white Mitsubishi Colt bakkie. No injuries were reported,” he added.
