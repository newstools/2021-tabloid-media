A manhunt is underway to find the gunmen accused of the murder of 32- year old taxi owner, Sabelo Madlala, who was shot and killed while asleep in his home at the Burlington Informal Settlement, Malvern. Madlala was asleep when his nephew, Lungelo Shange, who lives next door to him, heard gunshots coming from the household. According to Malvern SAPS communications officer, Seargent Kheswa, Shange phoned his uncle and he heard him cry. “The nephew went to inspect his uncle’s house and found the lounge window open. The nephew immediately called his uncle’s bodyguard, Blessing Khoza, telephonically, and informed him of what had happened. The bodyguard arrived and entered the house and found Madlala lying in his bed with gunshot wounds to his chest region,” said Kheswa. Madlala was still alive when he was rushed to R.K. Khan Hospital by his brother, Lungisane Madlala, and his nephew, however, he succumbed to his injuries.  “The crime scene was cordoned off and inspected. Five empty cartridges were found next to the deceased’s bed. R8 000 in cash and a cellphone which was on the table was not taken. Police suspect the murder was taxi-violence related,” added Khwesa.
