The end of Child Protection Week does not mean the end of one’s responsibility in looking after, protecting and stopping the abuse of children. That is message being encouraged by Child Welfare Chatsworth who called on residents to wear a green ribbon in support of children’s rights and responsibilities. Being one of the largest child protection organisations within the community, CWC strongly believes that every child should be protected from any form of harm. Director of the organisation, Salochana Moodley, said this year’s Child Protection Week focused on protecting the rights of children and reducing the impact of Covid-19 on them. “As the number of Covid-19 deaths increases more children will be orphaned and be vulnerable to abuse. Families are primarily responsible for the protection of their children and an appeal is made for parents and caregivers to make sure their children are safe during Covid-19. Parents should supervise and support their children’s online activities. They must ensure safe and responsible use of the internet, protecting our children at all times,” said Moodley. She added that child protection is everyone’s business and that all cases of abuse, neglect and rights being violated should be reported to relevant authorities. “Let us all stand together and curb the scourge of abuse.  Child Protection Week aims to mobilise all sectors of society to care for and protect our children. Child Welfare Chatsworth firmly believes that children should not only be acknowledged through these campaigns but celebrated and cherished everyday of their lives to reach their full potential through love, commitment, dedication, support, and understanding in order to build strong future leaders,” Moodley said.
