Speaking to the Ladysmith Herald, Ziqubu Misani and Duze Lungelo, who are both unemployed, said that they are willing to take their chances and hope to make some money. “We have been here most of yesterday, but today is our lucky day,” said Misani, who showed off what he believes is a real diamond. Lungelo also said he believes that his treasure is real. “This is the reason why so many people are out here.” The community could be seen digging through rocks and mud in search of what appears to be diamonds, with community members trying to sell them off. Four of the diggers showed large ‘diamond-like’ stones which they tried to sell to the Ladysmith Herald. Many have struck it lucky, but could not say for sure if the piece of shiny rock in their possession is a diamond. Many were seen without masks and not adhering to social distancing.  “We must dig and try and get in as much as we can, before the government officials come and take it away,” said another. Premier Sihle Zikalala said that the KwaZulu-Natal government has “noted with concern”, the reports of illegal mining activity taking place. Images and videos have been circulating on social media where some involved in the illegal mining are seen celebrating with the belief that they had struck it rich. Zikalala said that the provincial government tasked the Department of Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs to refer the matter to the national Department of Minerals and Energy (DMRE) as the relevant department which deals with such things. “DMRE has promised to dispatch teams to the site. These teams include the department’s enforcement and compliance unit to conduct an inspection of the site. The second team includes a team from Mintek (the council for Mineral Technology) and GCS (the Council for Geoscience). The Mintek and GCS teams will include a geologist and will focus on establishing exactly these items that have been discovered in KwaHlathi, Douglas,” he said. “We are deeply concerned about the images showing that some people coming from as far as some of the neighbouring provinces and towns are flocking into kwaHlathi. We are worried that if not brought under control the situation could result in chaos and a possible stampede. We call for order and calm and urge all those involved to cease their operations and vacate the site so as to allow DMRE to conduct a proper inspection of the site and of what has been discovered there,” Zikalala said. The premier added that the illegal mining activities could be in violation of the Covid-19 regulations. “It is also very concerning that in the wake of a looming third wave we have so many people gathered in one spot, not maintaining social distancing and not wearing masks. This could prove to be a super-spreader and might put many people at risk including those who are not part of the mining”. At the time when the Ladysmith Herald was on scene, no councillor or police could be seen.
