An investigation is underway to determine the cause of a fire that ripped through a Waterloo family home while four children were left alone allegedly by their mother who had gone out drinking on a Sunday night. According to Reaction Unit South Africa (RUSA), who responded to the incident on Donkey Road in Waterloo, the four girls managed to escape their burning home minutes before the roof caved in after the property was engulfed in flames. Their mother had allegedly left her four children at home to go out drinking at a local shebeen and returned in a drunken state to find her house destroyed in a fire. RUSA spokesperson, Prem Balram, said the eThekweni Fire Department and Metro Police responded swiftly to the scene. “Reaction officers interviewed the neighbours and established that the four children were home alone while the single mother was out consuming liquor at a shebeen in Waterloo. The woman returned home when she received news that her home had been destroyed by fire.” Metro police spokesperson, Superintendent Parbhoo Sewpersad, said the police got a call at 10pm on Sunday night alerting them about the blaze. “When metro arrived the house was well alight. “The police managed to evacuate everyone safely and we can confirm there were no deaths or injuries. We cannot confirm if the mother was drunk and no charges have been opened. The cause of the fire is still unknown.”
