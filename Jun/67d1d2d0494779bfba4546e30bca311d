She was threatened to be killed should she report the matter to anyone,” said Captain Nqobile Gwala. The victim informed her mother of what transpired and a case of rape was opened at Madadeni SAPS. The docket was transferred to Newcastle Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit for further investigation after the suspect was arrested on Thursday morning by the FCS Unit.
