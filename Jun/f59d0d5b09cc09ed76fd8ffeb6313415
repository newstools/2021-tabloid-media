A few minutes late, the same vehicle reversed to the victim and three unknown males forcefully grabbed her into the vehicle. Inside the vehicle were three other males. The vehicle drove to a place unknown to the victim where they all raped her. They then putted her inside the vehicle boot and dropped her at Inanda. Her cell phone wallet with cash and bank cards were also taken.” Mbele said police are appealing to anyone who may have information regarding the males in the attached pictures to contact the investigating officer Detective Sergeant Cele on 083 3001 371  or Crime Stop on 08600 10111.
