A Steadville man, 20, will be appearing in the Ladysmith Magistrate’s Court after brutally beating a 60-year-old man to death in the early hours of Saturday morning, 5 June. The victim’s body was discovered in a pool of blood outside Sandile Shabalala’s home along Anton Lembede Street. It is alleged that Shabalala had accused the 60-year-old of being involved in witchcraft and started attacking him. Steadville witnesses told the Ladysmith Police that they heard shouting and people arguing, but did not take notice of it. “It was too cold to even look out the window and after a few minutes it had gone quiet,” said a nearby resident. Police present closed off the scene of the crime and started collecting their evidence. On closer inspection, a blood trail was found from the deceased’s body leading the police straight to the suspect’s door. Police said that the suspect still had blood on his pants when they were found inside the house. The man was arrested and charged for the murder. The deceased has not yet been officially identified.
