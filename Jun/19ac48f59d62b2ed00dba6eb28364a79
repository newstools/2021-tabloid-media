An informative Family Law Clinic will be held on Thursday, 17 June at the Nelson Mandela Community Youth Centre in Chatsworth.

Both organisations will assist families in matters relating to domestic issues such as domestic violence, child abuse, abuse of the aged, maintenance issues, marital conflict, guardianship, adoption and any other areas of family conflict requiring counselling and/or legal resolution. Freedoms SA will also advise and assist people with clearing of criminal records. There will be lawyers at hand to provide legal advice and draw up wills for free. Wayne Jean-Pierre from Freedoms SA said: “The clinic will start at 9.15am. We will deal with the ‘ins and outs of marriages’, providing legal advice on the status of persons and children. At 10am we will cover maintenance. At 11am we will discuss the Children’s Act which will cover primary residence, access, foster care and adoption. At 12 noon we will cover the Sexual Offences Act with regard to rape and sexual assault of children.
