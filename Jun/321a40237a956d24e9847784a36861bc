An intelligence driven police operation was conducted on Sunday morning in the Alexandra policing area to search for the outstanding suspects that are terrorising the residents of Pietermaritzburg and surrounding areas. After the police received information about the whereabouts of the gang, they went to a lodge that is situated on Woodhouse Road not far from where seven suspects were killed in a shoot-out with police on Tuesday, 1 June. Four suspects, between the ages of 18 and 30 were arrested at the lodge. “Each suspect was found in possession of an illegal pistol with ammunition. The suspects are linked to a string of murders that were committed in the Pietermaritzburg, Imbali, Richmond, and Bergville areas.  The suspects will appear in the Pietermaritzburg Magistrate’s Court,” said Colonel Thembeka Mbele.
