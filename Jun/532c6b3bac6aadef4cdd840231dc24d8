UThukela District Mayor Siphiwe Mazibuko embarked on a three-stop visit to lend a helping hand to those in need and support the Covid-19 vaccination drive. He was accompanied on his first visit to the Gorton Bridge and Amahlubimangwe primary schools by  members of the Gift of the Givers and the uThukela District Youth Office. There they donated over 150 sanitary packs to learners. The overall initiative of this project was to bring confidence to the learners and also ensure that a child does not miss out on schooling. Mazibuko also reminded educators and learners that although some Covid-19 restrictions are lifted, the pandemic was not yet over so they need to adhere to rules and regulations by wearing a mask at all times, washing their hands and maintaining social distancing. “We would like to  take this opportunity to express our sincere appreciation to our private partners, Gift of the Givers,  who joined us in making a difference in the lives of young girls who are in need. Together let us create a caring society that loves its children,” said  Mazibuko. After the donation hand-over at the schools, Maziibuko and uThukela officials headed to Ward 5,  Ekuphumuleni in the KwaNgova area,  where the community witnessed the ongoing progress that uThukela District has made with the newly-drilled borehole. Speaking at the site after handing over a new hand pump, he emphasised that it was the municipality’s responsibility to supply potable water to the people. Mazibuko said two boreholes were reported to be faulty, but that it would be sorted out in the next few weeks.  The last stop of the day was the Ladysmith Provincial Nurses Home to lend support to people over 60 receiving their vaccinations and to encourage others to get their jabs.
