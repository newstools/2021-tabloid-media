It is that time of the year again, when contestants vie for the crown of Miss Home Meah 2021. Rochè Agenbag, a patron to the home for abandoned babies, has been doing fundraising for the non-profit organisation for as long as she can remember. “When I first heard about Home Meah, I decided to go and visit the place to see what they actually did. My heart fell in love with the children immediately and the year after that I had the First Miss HM which was aimed at raising funds. This will be the fifth one so far,” said Agenbag. Home Meah, which is a registered child and youth care centre that specialises in the care of babies and toddlers between the ages of 0-5 years old, has been lacking in donations and funding due to the Covid-19 pandemic. “It is sad because I cannot even go and visit the babies because of the Coronavirus. Home Meah is like my family. I love the children and my heart goes out to them. By hosting this pageant, all proceeds will go to Home Meah and it will then be used to assist the babies and toddlers who are under the home’s care,” said Agenbag. The pageant is set to take place on 14 August and there are currently eight spaces left. If you would like to enter the Miss HM 2021 Pageant or assist with any donations, kindly contact Rochè Agenbag via WhatsApp on 082-099-7279.
