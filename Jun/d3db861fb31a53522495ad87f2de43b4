The killers of two members of the Bergville Taxi Association, who were gunned down in the Anglican Church yard last month, were among those killed in a shoot-out with police in Scottsville. Police minister Bheki Cele said the ‘big boss’ of a gang, which had not only ordered ‘hits’ and struck fear in the community of Pietermaritzburg but had also rained terror in Bergville, was killed in a gun battle with police and a private security company in Scottsville on Tuesday afternoon, 1 June.  Five men and two women who were suspected gang members were shot dead. Cele said the incident took place in Fairfield Avenue and that one of the main suspects was being treated for injuries sustained during the  Bergville shooting. “These men had been in Bergville and were ordered to kill people,” said Cele. The two members of the Bergville Taxi Association, chairperson Bongani Zwane and treasurer Notikiza Hlatshwayo, were gunned down in the Anglican Church yard, along South Street in Bergville on Wednesday afternoon, 5 May. The Anglican Church is just a few metres from the Bergville Police Station.  Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said police had received a tip-off about the location of the ‘gang’ in Scottsville.  “They had been renting the house since the beginning of May. When the suspects noticed the police, they started shooting and there was an exchange of fire,” said Mbhele. It is also reported that the suspects were the prisoners who had escaped earlier.
