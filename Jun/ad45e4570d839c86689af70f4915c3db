A warrant officer from police crime intelligence stopped fleeing armed hijackers in their tracks, after a high-speed car chase ended in a shoot-out along Burger Street. The officer had been in the area on Friday evening, 11 June, when police were alerted that robbers had held up a resident at gunpoint in Lucknow Road, taking two vehicles. The officer decided to assist and noticed the suspects in one of the identified vehicles.  “The CI member spotted the hijacked vehicle driving along Progress Road and followed the vehicle from a distance to monitor its movement,” said police officers on the scene. When the suspects noticed their vehicle being followed, they began speeding and opened fire on the officer. The officer then retaliated and opened fire on the vehicle. A high-speed car chased ensued along Burger Street and the driver lost control of the vehicle. It is believed that one of the suspects had been injured as a blood trail was found in and around the vehicle. The suspects fled into the bush and members of the K9 unit brought their dogs to search for the armed suspects. Police were still searching for the men at the time of going to press. Community members reported that this group of suspects have been terrorising residents in the Acaciavale area.
