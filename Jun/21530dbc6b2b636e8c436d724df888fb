The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Saudi Arabia announced on 12 June that registration for those wishing to perform the Hajj rituals for the year 1442 is limited to 60 000 and only to citizens and residents from within the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The Ministry said that this decision was taken “due to what the world is witnessing with the continuing developments of the Covid-19 pandemic and the emergence of new variations.” Moaaz Casoo, the secretary general of the SA Hajj and Umrah Council (SAHUC) said that it is “really sad” that for a second year in a row, South Africans along with other Muslims cannot partake in Hajj. “We agree with the decision taken by the Ministry of Hajj and Umrah under the current Covid-19 pandemic, the Saudi government is fair to all countries by not allowing any Muslim from outside of the Kingdom to partake in Hajj 1442/2021. Alhamdullilah, majority of the  South African pilgrims that are waiting in the queue for Hajj are understanding of the current global issues experienced and are willing to wait until everything becomes more clear.” Casoo said that we also need to keep in mind that one of the requirements for Hajj 1442 is that pilgrims must have taken the vaccine and only people between the ages of 18-65 are allowed for Hajj this year.
