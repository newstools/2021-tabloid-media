The illicit drug trade in KwaZulu-Natal and the rest of the country is slowly being picked apart by members of the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks) who swooped in and raided a container filled with cocaine, estimated to be worth R243 million, in Isipingo Beach. The raid conducted by the Hawks Serious Organised Crime Investigation team with the members from Durban Harbour and Crime Intelligence Border Security, at a container depot on Avenue East, was a result of a tip-off. The raid that unearthed 26 canvas bags with TikTok and Jaguar brands, weighing 541 kilograms, was conducted in the early hours of Tuesday morning, 22 June. According to the Hawks, the container was meant to be filled with animal food. The national head of the Hawks, Lieutenant General Godfrey Lebeya, praised the team for uncovering the consignment of drugs and said the net is closing in on drug cartels. “This drug bust shows that there are organised criminal groupings that are involved in organising the movement of these dangerous dependence-producing substances from one country to the other. While fighting the supply of these substances, we appeal to the community not to demand the supply which will ultimately help in closing the market.” Isipingo Community Police Forum chairperson, Aidan David, hailed the bust and said: “The community must be commended for providing intel that led to the successful recovery of the massive consignment of narcotics. It is incredible to see that members of the public are active participants in fighting crime and not mere complainants. The police are also applauded on the huge victory and a job well done. It is hoped that after all that hard work, the judicial system does not fail us. Justice must be served and it is fantastic to note that we have scored a notable win in the battle against drugs.”
