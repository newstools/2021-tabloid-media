The public is advised that the Moses Mabhida Peopleâ€™s Park vaccination site will now be open on Saturdays and Sundays from 8am to 4pm. The decision to open the site on weekends was taken because it is one of the busiest in the city. The current vaccine rollout phase is targeting people aged 60 and older. People are urged to register first for the vaccine. Once registered, you will receive an SMS with the date, time and place to get your vaccination.
