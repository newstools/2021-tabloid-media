The friends and family of murdered KwaMakhutha resident, Anele Bhengu, are calling for bail to be denied when murder accused, Thulani Cele reappears at the Umbumbulu Magistrate’s Court on 30 June. “An animal like that does not deserve bail, he should not be let out back into society,” one protester said. Cele, 39, stands accused of multiple counts including murder and rape. He is alleged to have been party to the brutal murder of Bhengu, 29, whose mutilated body was found on 13 June at Hill area in KwaMakhutha, She had been raped, stabbed, had her throat slit and her stomach had been cut open; all done allegedly by Cele because she identified as a lesbian. Her aunt, Nonto Bhengu, said the family welcomed the arrest of the suspect. “We want bail to be denied and for him to rot in jail.” When asked if the family was familiar with the suspect, Bhengu said, “We did not know that a man such as this lived in our area. I had never seen him before or heard of him around the neighbourhood, so we are shocked and still wondering why he targeted Anele.” KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbele, said the suspect was arrested four days after the incident in Port Shepstone, where he was hiding out. Cele made his first appearance on 21 June. The community and members of the LGBTQIA+ community turned up in their numbers outside to support and stand in solidarity with the Bhengu family. Hlengiwe Buthlezi, director of the LGBTQIA+ organisation said, “We welcome the arrest. This is a step in the right direction, however, we are watching this case closely and we move towards the conviction of this criminal. We are asking for no bail and we are saying that we want a heavier sentence. We are now saying bring back the death penalty sikhathele bo (we are tired), he must rot in jail.” Anele was laid to rest on 19 June with the funeral taking place at the Siphumelele Hall in KwaMakhutha.
