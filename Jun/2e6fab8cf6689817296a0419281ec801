It was a major victory in the battle against the drug trade when police scored a whopping R243 million cocaine bust at a container depot on Avenue East in Isipingo after information of drugs being smuggling into the country was received in the early hours of Tuesday morning. The Hawks’ Serious Organised Crime Investigation team with the members from Durban Harbour as well as Crime Intelligence Border Security proceeded to the depot where the container which supposedly had animal food was identified and a search was conducted. Hawks spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Philani Nkwalase said: “Twenty-six canvas bags with Tik Tok and Jaguar brands were found with bricks of cocaine. The drugs weigh 541 kilograms with an estimated value of more than R243 million and were confiscated. An investigation to apprehend the perpetrators and prevent contraband drugs into our country is continuing.” The National Head of the Hawks Lieutenant General Godfrey Lebeya praised the team about the consignment of drugs uncovered. He said: “We are closing in on the drug cartels. This drug bust shows that there are organised criminal groupings that are involved in organising the movement of these dangerous dependent producing substances from one country to the other. While fighting the supply of these substances, we appeal to the community not to demand the supply which will ultimately help in closing the market.”
