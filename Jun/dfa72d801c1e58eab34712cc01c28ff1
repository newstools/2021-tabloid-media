In commemoration of this yearâ€™s PTSD Awareness Day, the North Durban Victim Support Team, a group of trained volunteers who offer free trauma-debriefing to their community, will be raising awareness on 27 June by encouraging members of the community to wear something teal, as this is the colour that represents PTSD awareness. Post-traumatic stress disorder is a mental health condition that is triggered by a traumatic event by either witnessing or experiencing it. The North Durban Victim Support Team can be contacted on 066-483-8589. Members of the community should contact the team or share their details to anyone in need of counselling.
