South Africa has recorded the highest number of positive Covid-19 cases since January when the country struggled to contain the 501Y.V2 variant; with Newcastle experiencing a sudden spike. By Wednesday last week, the daily positive cases reached 13 246. The National Institute for Communicable Diseases said the number of positive results out of the total daily tests had also increased to 21.7% nationally. President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced that South Africa’s lockdown regulations will be tightened as the country grapples with the third wave of Covid-19. In a national address on Tuesday, 25 June, the president said that the country will move to level three of lockdown from midnight to stop the health facilities from being overwhelmed. He went on to say that the priority now is to ensure that there are enough beds and healthcare workers to give the best possible care to those who need it. Mediclinic Newcastle Hospital Manager, Japie Greyling, said that there has been an increase in positive cases in the town. “Mediclinic Newcastle can confirm that, as is the case across the region and country, we have noted a strong, sudden and sustained increase in the amount of Covid-19 patients presenting for care. As such, we are implementing additional measures to increase the capacity. The hospital has implemented a system to isolate Covid-19 positive and negative patients. Elective surgery continues safely at this point in time,” said Greyling. He further encouraged members of the community to seek medical attention for all medical conditions, even those unrelated to the Covid-19 pandemic. “We call upon members of the community to continue to practise all the necessary preventative measures to reduce the risk of contracting the coronavirus,” said Greyling.
