It was a major coup for police officers from the Provincial Trio and Vehicle Task Team when they netted nine suspects and seized five firearms as well as ammunition, in Isipingo, south of Durban, on Sunday. Police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbele said the police officers received information about suspicious individuals travelling in a bakkie with no registration plates along the Isipingo Old Main Road. “The police officers immediately responded and spotted the vehicle, which was intercepted. Upon searching the vehicle, the police officers discovered five pistols as well as ammunition in possession of the occupants. It was established that two of the pistols had their serial numbers filed off and one of the pistols belonged to a deceased person. The suspects will be profiled to check if they are linked to other criminal cases. The firearms were seized and will be subjected to ballistic testing. Nine suspects aged between 27 and 47 were placed under arrest for being in unlawful possession of firearms and ammunition,” Col Mbele added. The suspects will appear before the Durban Magistrate’s Court today (Tuesday).
