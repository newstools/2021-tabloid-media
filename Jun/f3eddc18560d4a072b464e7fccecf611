ActionSA successfully launched 17 new branches in the KZN district on Monday, 7 June, welcoming over 500 new members into the ranks of South Africans who are committed to fighting for ethical leadership, good governance and service delivery in each of our communities. Amajuba Regional manager and mayoral candidate, Faizel Cassim, says that he is very humbled to see the success in a short space of time. “It was just a vision a few months ago that we will paint our disctrict green, and this vision has now become a reality. With the support from all our residents we would like to paint this town green and bring back Newcastle to its glory days. It is going to be a tough journey but I am positive with the support of our people we will achieve our goals,” said Cassim.Following the launch, Amajuba District is the only district in the country to boast ActionSA branches in every one of the 34 wards. “Together as a community we will overcome all obstacles that our current South African municipalities face, because I believe that Newcastle citizens are unique and have proven this on many occasions. One of the current examples is the Covid-19 crisis which gathered assistance from all walks of society and races which, in turn, brought many businesses and people together. There are some outstanding people in Newcastle who go the extra mile for our people, but who choose to remain anonymous and I feel that these people deserve special awards for their dedication towards the betterment of the people in our town. I thank you from the bottom of my heart,” added Cassim.
