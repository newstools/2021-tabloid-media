The late long-standing resident of Westville, Colin Ross was honoured by the Westville Conservancy and the Ross family at a recent tree-planting ceremony in the Westville Scout Bowl. Ross passed away earlier this year. Colin Ross lived most of his 90-year life in Westville. He was an active member of the Westville community in various capacities, until ill health and advanced age slowed him down. Colin played a leadership role in business in both Westville and Durban, in his local faith community of  St Elizabeth’s Anglican Church, and even in his retirement on various committees such as that of the Bergtheil Museum, the Westville Conservancy and the Recycling Forum. Susan Smith of Westville Conservancy said: “Douglas was the first chairperson of the Westville Conservancy. It was only fitting that the Westville Conservancy donated two indigenous trees in memory of Colin’s dedication and service to the Conservancy in particular.” The trees which were chosen by Colin’s widow, Moira Ross, were a Natal Mahogany (Trichelia dregeana) and a Forest Toad tree (Tabernaemontana ventricosa). “The Natal Mahogany was chosen as there was once a massive Natal Mahogany tree in the old Ross family home in Northcliffe Avenue in Westville, while the Forest Toad tree was one of Colin’s favourite trees in his retirement home also in Westville,” said Douglas Ross, Collin’s son. He added that his father is sorely missed by family and friends, and those whose lives he touched over the years.
