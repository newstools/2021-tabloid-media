Sandile Shabalala, 20, who allegedly beat to death a 60-year-old man accused of practising witchcraft, has been denied bail. The beating apparently took place in the early hours of Saturday morning, 6 June along Anton Lembede Street in Steadville. Shabalala appeared briefly in the Ladysmith Magistrate’s Court and bail was denied.  He was arrested at his home, just a few steps from where the body of the dead man was found. Police had found Shabalala asleep while wearing blood stained pants. “Police had followed a blood trail from the body of the victim to the door of the suspect and he was arrested,” said police.
