On Friday, Kuwag Skool in Amanzimtoti had to play host to a number of educators who were eager to receive their Covid-19 jab. The school, which was authorised by the Department of Education to be a vaccination site, said they welcomed being selected to be part of history. The South African Democratic Teachers’ Union said they are happy and remain positive about the progress of the vaccination programme. Mbuso Shabalala Region secretary, under SADTU in the Ugu District, Vuyani Mbhele, said on the first day of vaccination, 23 June, a total of 970 educators were vaccinated. The following day, 24 June, 1 620 educators received their jab, bringing the region closer to their target of 7 863 in public schools. However, Mbhele noted the concerns raised by school governing body educators who have been temporarily sidelined by the department. “It is not that they will not be part of the vaccination programme, the SGB educators do not appear on the persal system which makes it harder for them to be tracked. All SGB educators will be vaccinated in due course.” Mbhele said the union in the region was positive about the outcomes of the vaccination programme, so far. “We did not make a mistake in agreeing to the vaccination of educators, the results and their eagerness prove this so. From what we have seen since the start of the vaccination of educators, we are very positive that the department will reach their target within the allocated time. The educators are positive and so are we.” By 24 June, a total of 44 733 educators and support staff had been vaccinated.
