Residents, especially kids from the nearby flats and Plane Street low-cost homes in Tongaat Central, came together to participate in a number of sporting activities in honour of the youth of 1976 who protested against the use of Afrikaans as a medium of instruction in schools.        Children participated in a number of games and novelty events, such as the egg and spoon race, sack race, needle and thread, bean-bag picking, donkey derby and tug-o-war. However, the highlight of the day was the fierce soccer battle between Belvedere and Plane Street youth. Mohanlal said the purpose of the sports programme is to keep the children occupied and away from social evils. She said: “We are passionate about sports and support young people who show an appetite for development not only in sports, but also life skills. Our objective is to make this a long-term initiative not only on Youth Day but in the future. Not only did the volunteers provide the sport programme but the children were also treated to a sumptuous breakfast and lunch, medals and a goodie bag.”  Former Tongaat Crusaders soccer player, Reuben Pillay, said Belvedere is one of the biggest suburbs on the north with no playing facilities for children, “Therefore the children are forced to play in open, undeveloped spaces. An appeal is made to the ward councillor to upgrade the undeveloped open space immediately and request a stadium from the municipality for the future.” The newly-elected sports committee candidate, Mervin Naidoo, represents soccer in Ward 61. He said that this matter was addressed numerous times with the ward councillor, by Pillay, and it seems as though all of his complaints have fallen on deaf ears. “However, since being elected on the sports committee they are going to put pressure on the office of the ward councillor to investigate the matter and revert back to the people. Finally the community activists want to thank our volunteers for the meals provided on the day and a very special appeal is made to business houses to pledge their support by sponsoring the kids with sporting equipment and outfits in order to have a drug-free township.”  Councillor Dolly Munien said while there may be limited space for children, the community should note that certain areas cannot be used for big sporting events. “On smaller grounds such as these, when children play a sport that requires a ball, the ball can easily go into someone’s yard and damage property. Recently a ball went astray and hit a 74-year-old lady. There are grounds provided for people to play on rather than these small plots of land. However, I do agree that Parks and Gardens need to do a better job in maintaining playgrounds for children.”
