The public is advised that the Moses Mabhida Peopleâ€™s Park vaccination site will now be open on Saturdays and Sundays from 8am to 4pm.  The decision to open the site on weekends was taken because it is one of the busiest sites in the city. The vaccine roll-out is being done in phases with the current phase targeting people aged 60 and older. Residents are urged to register first for the vaccine. Once registered, you will receive an SMS with the date, time and place to get your vaccination.
