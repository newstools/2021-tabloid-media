A 27- year-old woman managed to escape her fire engulfed room by forcing her body through a small window and burglar bars in the early hours of Wednesday morning. The woman, who wishes to remain anonymous, told The Ladysmith Herald that she had to think quickly to get out of the house and that the window was the only option. “I did hurt myself, but it was either that or being trapped in the house,” said the woman, who was still clearly in shock . She said that she was asleep in her room along Klipbank Road, when she was woken by voices and footsteps in the garden. “I managed to make my way to the kitchen window and noticed flames and smoke coming from the garage. I could not make my way out and rushed  back to my room to get my phone. It is then that I heard a window break and just saw flames,” said the woman. She said that within seconds the room was on fire and black smoke was filling the house. “I reached for the window and somehow I managed to escape and rushed to the neighbours to call for help.” The Alfred Duma Municipal Fire Department was called and the fire was extinguished in the room and garage. Police are investigating claims made by the woman and the house was set alight deliberately.  She said that she is grateful to be alive and hopes that the police will catch the culprits.
