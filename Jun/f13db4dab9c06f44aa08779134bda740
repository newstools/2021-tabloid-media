Verulam SAPS are working around the clock to identify a murder victim who was found in the bushes on Tottenham Road in Ottawa on Sunday, 13 June.  The lifeless body of a woman, suspected to have been raped, was discovered by a herdsman next to the Durban Solid Waste Depot on Tottenham Road, Ottawa. Reaction Unit South Africa (RUSA) received a call from a passerby and investigated the matter. RUSA spokesperson, Prem Balram, said on arrival their officers and paramedics were led to a bush where a female was located, lying in a prone position. “Her top was found around her waist and her jeans were pulled down. The deceased appears to be in her 20 s. She sustained a stab wound to the right side of her chest and blunt force trauma to her face and is believed to have been raped.” Her identity has not been established at this stage. Verulam SAPS spokesperson, Captain Henry Kisten said, “A case of murder was opened and is currently under investigation. The crime scene was on Rietriver behind the Ottawa Clinic.” The community is urged to always be vigilant and to try to travel in larger groups as criminals tend to target those who are alone.
