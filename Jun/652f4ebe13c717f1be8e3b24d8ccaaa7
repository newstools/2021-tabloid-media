There was cause for a double celebration in the Chetty household when twins, Trevisha and Trishana, 22, graduated with Bachelor of Business Science degrees at the University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) recently. Trevisha completed her cum laude, while Trishana received a Dean’s Commendation and merit certificates, winning them both scholarships to continue their studies. Trevisha said: “In high school, mathematics and accounting were our strengths. We loved to take on challenges and found both subjects very interesting, so we applied for the Bachelor of Business Science course and chose mathematics, statistics and finance as our majors.” She said that she and her sister built great friendships along the way and even though it did get a bit challenging and hectic at times, knew the rewards were going to be great and worthwhile. “We would definitely recommend studying business science for those going into a competitive job market as the degree opens more career paths and job opportunities, such as choosing the statistics field instead of just finance.” Trishana the second twin said: “We were honoured to be members of the executive committee of the 2019/20 Golden Key Society at UKZN-Westville.” Trevisha was Public Relations Director while Trishana was Treasurer. They thanked their parents and extended family for support, inspiration and guidance in their academic journeys. “Our family  is really proud of us and excited to celebrate our achievement,” said Trishana. Trevisha is  working for the Absa group, whilst Trishana is currently completing an Honours degree in Statistics at UKZN and will join PricewaterhouseCoopers foundation (PwC) next year  for the Future Graduate Programme. “We both look forward to moving to Johannesburg at the end of this year,” said Trishana. “We can definitely say that holding a Bachelor of Business Science degree has played a key role in providing us with the necessary knowledge and skills required in the corporate world,” added Trevisha.
