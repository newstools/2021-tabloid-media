After four decades of dedicated service to the South African Police Service (SAPS), Warrant Officer Jayraj Thool will lay down his uniform as he steps into retirement. As a valued member of the police service, Thool’s history in the SAPS is a culmination of the excellent services he rendered determinedly and untiringly since he joined SAPS on 1 January 1981. Communications officer at Montclair SAPS, Captain Derek Vijiam said Thool brought his vast knowledge to Montclair Vispol Unit at a time when many needed his experience. “His determination and work ethic enabled him to never shy away from the challenges he encountered, but instead it sharpened and motivated his skills to drive his shift to become one of the vital components at Montclair SAPS. Thool, you have carried burdens of injury aside to serve the South African Police Service and rendered your unsung services with pride. You have not displayed any element of weariness and tiredness, even when the burden was becoming heavier.” Viljam said even with serious injury, Thool continued to soldier on with ambition to ensure that the SAPS’s objectives and mandate were achieved. “Thool has the satisfaction of knowing that he has been a good foot-soldier who has never hesitated in the line of duty. Montclair SAPS applauds your dedication and all your years of hard work to serve and protect. We salute you!” Thool will be awarded a certificate of service and a memento on behalf of Montclair SAPS, as a gesture of appreciation for his loyal service.
