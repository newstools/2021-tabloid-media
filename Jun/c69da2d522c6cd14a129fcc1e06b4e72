Covid-19 vaccines for educators got off to a smooth start in Newcastle, with most in the education sector welcoming the jabs. At Lennoxton Primary School, educators were ecstatic to finally  receive their Johnson & Johnson vaccinations on 23 June. L.P.S was chosen as one of the vaccination sites. Among those vaccinated was principal Mr Y D Naidoo, Deputy Principal Mr M Z Dawood and the District Director of the Education Department, Mr Nzama. At this stage only government employed educators are receiving the vaccines, while SGB employed educators and support staff at schools will have to wait. Addressing the media during a briefing on Wednesday, KwaZulu-Natal Education MEC, Kwazi Mshengu, said educators who refused to get vaccinated would not be allowed to work from home. “We can’t force those who don’t want to vaccinate. It’s a voluntary decision, but what we have decided is that if you don’t vaccinate, you can’t then claim you still want to work remotely. You can’t get that benefit. If you don’t vaccinate there are things you can no longer claim like – ‘I have comorbidities and I need to work from home’.  You will not be able to do that because the government has provided you with the opportunity to vaccinate. Therefore, such things will no longer be available to them,” said Mshengu.  There are 96 vaccination sites in KwaZulu-Natal for the education sector, with the roll-out ending on 8 July. On Friday, acting Health Minister Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane said Covid-19 vaccination registration for the over-50s would be open from 1 July, and their vaccinations would begin from 15 July.
