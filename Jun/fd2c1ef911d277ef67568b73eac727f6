Community members in  the Tsakhane area, Steadville embarked on a violent protest to demand the removal of 14 educators at a local school. Accusations of misconduct have been levelled at the educators who teach at the Silindokuhle High School, with members of the community claiming that their children are not receiving a proper education. The group of about 40 protestors, who wished to remain anonymous, said they want the educators removed from the school and called on the MEC for the Department of Education Kwazi Mshengu to step in. “If you identify us, the police will come for us and our children that go to the school will be victimised. They are coming in drunk, late or not at all and don’t care about our children’s education,” said one of the community members. The protestors closed off Pieters Road on Thursday morning, 3 June with burning tyres, broken bottles and huge rocks. Motorists were forced to seek alternative routes to find their way to work and school. Protestors said they would continue with their protest until they can see the MEC.  “The MEC must come with all his officials and then he will see the problems at this high school,” said another community member.  Protestors told The Ladysmith Herald to make matters worse, two community members were arrested and charged for intimidation because they had entered the school on Wednesday morning, 2 June to have the educators removed. “The police were called in and two people were arrested. Why are we being seen as the criminals, when it is the educators that are doing an injustice to our children.” Police confirmed that a case of intimidation was opened and that two people had been arrested. At the time of going to press the Department of Education was not available for comment.
