A 16-year-old female was raped and robbed in a pathway leading from Tangerine Street, Trenance Park to Zwelisha, Amaotana on Sunday, 27 June. The victim was expected to meet friends in Gandhi Park, Central Verulam to celebrate a birthday party when she was approached by a male who started a conversation with her.  Reaction Unit South Africa (RUSA) spokesperson, Prem Balram, said: “During their conversation she informed him that her mother was unemployed and they were struggling financially. The suspect told her that he would be able to assist by arranging part-time employment for her as a domestic worker. The two then proceeded to KFC on Ireland Street where he bought her a meal before they boarded a minibus taxi to Trenance Park.”   Balram said the two alighted on the corner of Madronna Drive and Tangerine Street. “The suspect informed her that he knew a shortcut to their destination and followed him onto an unpaved road. Once they were in an isolated area, the man produced a knife and forced her to remove her pants and proceeded to rape the Grade 11 learner. The suspect stole her cellphone before he fled the scene on foot. The victim sought assistance from residents who contacted Reaction Unit South Africa (RUSA). Reaction officers conducted an extensive search for the suspect however he still remains at large.” Verulam SAPS spokesperson, Captain Henry Kisten, confirmed a case of rape was opened at the station and said the matter is currently under investigation.
