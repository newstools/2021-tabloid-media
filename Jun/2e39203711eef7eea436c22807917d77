A Limehill tuckshop owner in Ekuvukeni is recovering in a Dundee hospital, after he was tortured and burnt with hot water by five armed suspects. Ekuvukeni police said that the owner was closing up for the day, when five men forced their entry into his shop on Friday, 4 June. Police told the Ladysmith Herald: “He was held at gunpoint, as the suspects demanded cash. The victim gave the suspects money, but they demanded more. The suspects then hit the victim, held him down and started slowly pouring the boiling water over his chest and the rest of his body. The victim finally gave the suspects more money and they fled with cell phones, cigarettes and other items from the shop.” The victim then called for help and was rushed to the Dundee hospital. With information received from the community and a statement given by the victim, the Ekuvukeni police managed to trace three of the five suspects. The three were arrested and charged and will be appearing in Ekuvukeni Magistrate’s Court on charges of armed robbery. Police are still currently searching for two suspects and have asked that if anyone has any information that can assist the police in the case to contact the SAPS at 08600 10111 or use “MySAPS”App.
