Fingerprints lifted from two vodka bottles could lead to the arrest of the suspects responsible for the cold blooded killing of a man whose body was found in Woodview Park opposite a tavern, on Tuesday morning. Phoenix SAPS communications officer, Captain Louise Naidoo, said: “It is alleged by a witness that he saw the victim, identified only as John, who is believed to be homeless and aged about 30-years-old, drinking with two of his friends, known by sight, at the park opposite the tavern. The witness claims he went to bed nearby and heard screams later on but did not investigate. He (the witness) alleged he took a walk in the park on Tuesday morning and found the deceased with blood around him. He then alerted the police. Another witness alleged that the victim was seen with his friends at the tavern earlier on Monday evening. The second witness indicated that the victim and his friends were arguing at the tavern.” Cpt Naidoo added: “The deceased was found with four stab wounds (back and chest). No weapon was found at the scene, however, a view of the surroundings at the park indicates a struggle took place. A murder investigation is underway.” Phoenix Community Police Forum chairperson, Umesh Singh, said: “It is concerning that such violent crime is rampant within the Phoenix suburb. There appears to be a ruthlessness amongst some citizens to see blood spilled and a life snuffed out. Whatever the circumstances surrounding this killing, the perpetrators must be caught by police and justice must prevail.”
