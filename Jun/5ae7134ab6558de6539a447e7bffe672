Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs MEC, Ravi Pillay, made the announcement at a media briefing at the Ladysmith Town Hall, on Sunday, 20 June. Pillay said the preliminary report shows that the site of the informal mining is geographically located on the edge of a Karoo dolerite sill which is not in a zone where diamond occurrences are present. “After visiting the area and conducting tests, it has been confirmed that the stones are not diamonds, but are quartz crystals that are common across the Karoo Supergroup with an extensional fracture planes within and along the contact of Karoo dolerite sill, “ he said. While awaiting the results, the Ladysmith Herald visited the KwaHlathi site. The KwaHlathi area, depicted a different scene, on Sunday, 20 June. Huge deep holes could be seen along the rocky hill but the frenzied digging and search for the alleged diamonds seemed to have calmed down. Food hawkers at KwaHlathi believe that they are the only ones that have struck it lucky by selling meals to the illegal miners. “I have spent a week here, my stock is also finished and I’m ready to return to my bed, after spending a week long of cold nights, selling food,” said Nokuthula Ndlovu, who believes that she is the luckiest as she made ‘some serious cash’ whilst selling chips and bread to the miners. “I am heading home today, my stock is finished and I have made more than enough money,” said Ndlovu. Ndlovu said that she did not once dig in the ground, looking for treasures that had feverishly gripped many. Ndlovu said that she has made enough money. “I have worked hard and served the best fresh chips,” smiled Ndlovu. Bridget Magasela, who had sold hotdogs and tea also explained that she has been busy non-stop and despite only being at the site for two days, have made more money than what she had spent on the produce bought. Items from airtime to beer could be seen being sold by hawkers. A group of youngsters were trying desperately to sell the alleged diamond stones. A few illegal miners who were still on site said that it seems that everything had already been taken from the ground, by the previous illegal miners. “We tried our luck here today, but most of the stones that are found are extremely small and hardly look like anything,” said one illegal miner. He added that he is so hungry and tired, but will continue digging for his treasures. It is also said that some of the illegal miners left the site in fear of the police presence that has since increased on Tuesday. Sister and brother, Abongile Nfazi, 13 and Sibongakonke Miya, 12, from Uitval were among the illegal miners, proudly showing off their treasures in the hope that they will take home a real diamond. A few illegal miners, who wish to remain anonymous, said that they have been travelling up and down from Glencoe, but today it is quiet. “You can see some people have left, because they are scared of the police,” said the illegal miner. The miner added that he and his friends have a few of the stones already at home. When asked what they are going to do with the stones if it is confirmed that they are not diamonds, they laughed and said that they will use the stones as a reminder. Others still believe that what they are digging for are real diamonds. “I don’t really care what the leaders of our country think, these are diamonds that we are collecting. Do they know what it is like to go to bed with no food?” said one of the miners. Despite the results released, many still think that the government lying and that this is just a way to get people away from the site. The activity seen at KwaHlathi in the past week has highlighted the socio-economic challenges confronting people in the area. “We appeal to the people on site to vacate the area as what they are involved in has the potential to spread Covid-19. The illegal mining practices also have a negative impact on the environment and land degradation that has been accentuated by the extensive diggings in the area”, said the MEC during the meeting. “We also have to provide a comprehensive response to the socio-economic challenges raised by the community during our visit to the site and as communicated by community representatives during a meeting held earlier. We reiterate that the mining activity taking place at KwaHlathi is illegal. We urge the community to co-operate with the police and local leadership,” concluded the MEC.
