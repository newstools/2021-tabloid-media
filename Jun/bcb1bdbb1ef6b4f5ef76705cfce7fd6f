The officer was in the area when emergency calls were made, on the evening of Friday, 11 June, about armed robbers who had held up a resident at gunpoint in Lucknow Road before taking two vehicles. The officer decided to head out to assist in the house robbery when he noticed the suspects in one of the vehicles identified. “The CI member spotted the hijacked vehicle driving along Progress Road and followed the vehicle from a distance to monitor its movement,” said police officers on the scene. When the suspects noticed their vehicle being followed, they sped up and opened fire on the officer; who returned fire on the suspects’ vehicle. The suspects sped along Burger Street before losing control of the vehicle and veering off into the bush. It is believed that one of the suspects had been injured, as a blood trail was found in and around the vehicle. The suspects fled into the bush and members of the K9 unit were called to search the bushy area for the armed suspects. Police are still searching for the suspects who were also reported by community members to be the same group of men who have been terrorizing residents in the Acaciavale area.
