A Steadville man will be appearing in the Ladysmith Magistrate’s Court after brutally beating a 60-year-old man to death in the early hours of Saturday morning. The body of the unidentified man was discovered in a pool of blood outside the accused’s home along Anton Lembede Street. It is alleged that the deceased was accused of being involved in witchcraft. Witnesses told The Ladysmith Police that they heard shouting and people arguing, but did not pay much attention. “It was too cold to even look out the window and after a few minutes it was quiet,” said a nearby resident. Police cordoned off the crime scene of the crime and started collecting their evidence. A blood trail was found from the deceased’s body, leading the police straight to the door of the suspect. Police said the suspect still had blood on his pants when police entered the house. The man was arrested and charged with murder.
