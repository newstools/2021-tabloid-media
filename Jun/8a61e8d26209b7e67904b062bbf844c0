The mayor of Newcastle Municipality, Dr Ntuthuko Mahlaba, embarked on a series of engagements with leaders of the community regarding the upcoming elections; the first of which to be with the traditional leaders of the community, in order to seek divine intervention for peaceful elections. This took place on Wednesday, 12 May, at the council chambers. As part of the engagement series, the house, packed with interfaith communities, sought God’s intervention and guidance through the fast-approaching local government elections and to better understand the issues that relate to the town; and moreover how the Gospel compels government to respond as faithful citizens of the community. The Mayor alongside Deputy Mayor, Councillor Reuben Molelekoa, Chief Whip Councillor Dolly Mnguni and Acting Municipal Manager Vish Govender led off the second meeting of the engagement series with interfaith leaders at the Newcastle Farmers’ Hall. “These engagements were initiated because the Newcastle Municipality understands the significant role that the community-based leaders play in the overall welfare of the communities. It is also crucial to make these kinds of engagements to encourage the participation of stakeholders and for them to utilize such platforms to raise common societal issues,” said Mlungisi Khumalo, Head of Communications of the Municiality. Mayor Dr Ntuthuko Mahlaba reiterated that prayer is one of the most effective and efficient responses to social scourges such as violence and crime. “With this prayer, we aim to promote peaceful elections and for God to ordain the rightful leaders to carry the mandate bestowed upon them,” said Mahlaba.
