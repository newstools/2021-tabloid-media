With India suffering the brunt of the worldwide Covid-19 pandemic which brought the country to its knees during the second wave, Koovashan Naidoo, prompted by his uncle, teamed up with friends to host a charity park-off in Umhlatuzana. The event helped raise much-needed funds for those in India who are struggling to cope with basic needs and medical treatment while fighting the virus and losing loved ones. The categories at the park-off included best static, best engine bay, best boot set-up, best interior, best wheel, best bike and best old-school car. Residents from all areas showed their support by attending the event and contributing towards the worthy cause.
