The Westville Theatre Club show, ‘Yesterday Once More’ was a sold-out spectacular event with full-house attendance by members of the community. Media and public relations officer of the club, Dorothy O’ NeilI, said: “It was a great show with a full-house attendance which indicated that residents are ready to come back and watch live theatre shows. There were a few queries of “what’s next?” and we are thrilled to say there will be a play in early September. Audition notices will be going out soon once the play has been finalised.” Bianca Pretorius, who was part of the performance in the ‘Yesterday Once More’  show said:  “It was truly such a joy going on this nostalgic musical journey with our audiences and being able to relive some oldies but goldies – with everyone in attendance. The laughs, applause, cries, and sing-alongs are what we live for, and what keep us going. A special thanks goes to  all the cast members  and the audience for the support. The amount of gratitude we have is going to take more than words to show. We’ve had so much fun with these performances, but it’s time to rev up our engines and start working on the next one.” O’ Neill said the Westville Theatre Club’s Annual General Meeting is coming up soon. “It’s been a long year, but yet it still seems like yesterday we had our last AGM. This year’s AGM will be live. There will be real people and real contact meaning that all our lovely members are going to jump into their cars and speed their way to the theatre club on Tuesday,  27 July at 7pm. The members are urged to bring their membership money, so that their membership is updated. Notices of the meeting to all members will be sent out in due course and all members are encouraged to make an effort to attend, it will be lovely seeing everybody again,” O’ Neill said.
