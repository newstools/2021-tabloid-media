Going digital and streamlining learning has become the focus of the Department of Education and the Umdoni Municipality which recently handed over laptops to Esihle High School. The school based in Malangeni, was visited by Umdoni mayor, Sbongile Khathis, who rewarded the school with 20 laptops in addition to full uniforms. “Our vision as government is to see children from the rural communities having access to an education on par with advantaged schools so they may have equal opportunities.” Both the school management and the learners were beyond excited after receiving the learning equipment. The school management expressed their gratitude toward the municipality, thanking them for the laptops. If your school requires assistance with basic resources for leaners, contact your nearest councillor to reach out for similar running initiatives and programmes.
