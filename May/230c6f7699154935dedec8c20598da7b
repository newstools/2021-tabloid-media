The public has been warned against an alleged conman who has made people believe that he was investing their monies in Bitcoin. According to a victim, who did not want to be named, the conman had promised them greater return for their investment. “We as a group of friends and family gave sums of money in 2019. A total of R695 000 was handed over to him. He promised that the returns would be good. This seemed like a good investment opportunity for us,” he said. The conman had promised the victims up to 10 percent return. “He had even drafted paper work to verify the legitimacy of the investment. During 2019 he made payments back to us and the investment seemed legitimate. In January 2020 things started to go pear-shaped. He said there was an issue with the payments. He stated that the payment was stopped by SARS and that the payment will only be released in May 2020. “During this time he pretended to be communicating with SARS and due to Covid-19 the investigations were limited. In May 2020, he then advised that the payment is not being released by SARS and that the investment matures in November 2020 and he will pay the interest plus the capital back,” claimed the victim. The victims said in November last year, the conman started to make excuses as to why the payments were delayed. “From the middle of November he disappeared. He could not be traced or contacted. We know that there are other people affected but we do not have contact details,” he said. Captain Raymond Deokaran, communications officer of the Durban North SAPS, confirmed the incident and said a case was opened. “A case of theft under false pretence was opened between the year 2018/19 and further investigations are in place,” said Deokaran.
